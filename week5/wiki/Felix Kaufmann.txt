'''Felix Kaufmann''' (4 July 1895, [[Vienna]] – 23 December 1949, [[New York City|New York]]) was an Austrian-American [[philosopher of law]].

Kaufmann studied [[jurisprudence]] and [[philosophy]] in Vienna. From 1922 to 1938 he was a [[Privatdozent]] there. During this time Kaufmann was associated with the [[Vienna Circle]]. He also wrote on the [[foundations of mathematics]] where, along with [[Hermann Weyl]] and [[Oskar Becker]], he was attempting to apply the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of [[Edmund Husserl]] to [[constructive mathematics]].

In 1938, the conditions for [[Jewish]] scholars became too hard and he left for the USA. There he taught until his death as a law professor, in the Graduate Faculty of the [[New York School for Social Research]]. Kaufmann also aided fellow Austrian emigres in need of assistance during the pre-[[World War II|war]] years when the situation became dire for Jewish academics and scholars in [[Germany]] and [[Austria]]. Interceding on [[Karl Popper]]'s behalf, Popper was offered academic hospitality at [[Cambridge University]] and a stipend of £150 for one year - this offer was transferable, and [[Friedrich Waismann]] took it up when Popper went to [[New Zealand]] instead (see John Watkins in Proceedings of the British Academy, 94, 645-684, 652).

In 1936 he produced a book on the methodology of the social sciences (Kaufmann 1936). After moving to the United States he was invited to write a similar book in English, but what he produced (Kaufmann 1944) was significantly different, under the influence of Dewey's ''Logic: The Theory of Inquiry''. The original book was translated over 70 years later (Cohen and Helling 2014).
