Yiannopoulos has said there are many "points of difference" between him and the alt-right movement.<ref name="Chan4HtSt"/> A former senior editor for ''[[Breitbart News]]'', he describes himself as a "cultural [[libertarianism|libertarian]]".<ref>Greer, Scott (13 May 2016).

Born and raised in [[Kent]], Yiannopoulos is of mixed Greek, Irish, and Jewish heritage. After being expelled from [[Simon Langton Grammar School for Boys]], he studied at the [[University of Manchester]] and [[Wolfson College, Cambridge]] but failed to gain a degree from either. He began working in technology journalism for ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' before co-running ''The Kernel'', which was devoted to technology journalism, in 2011–13.{{cn|date=August 2017}} He was one of the first journalists to cover the [[Gamergate controversy]]. In 2015 he began work at Breitbart, attracting attention for his opinions and the company's association with the alt-right. He relocated to the United States, where he became a vocal supporter of [[Donald Trump]]'s presidential candidature. In July 2016 he was permanently banned from [[Twitter]] for what the company cited as "inciting or engaging in the targeted abuse or harassment of others".{{cn|date=August 2017}}

In February 2017, he resigned from Breitbart after a controversy arising from a video clip in which he said that sexual relationships between 13-year-old boys and adult men and women can be "perfectly consensual" and positive experiences for the boys.<ref name="NBCNewsUproar">{{cite web|last1=O'Hara|first1=Mary Emily|title=Yiannopoulos Quits Breitbart, Apologizes for Uproar Over Year-Old Comments|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/yiannopoulos-quits-breitbart-apologizes-uproar-over-year-old-comments-n723861|website=nbcnews.com|publisher=National Broadcasting Company|accessdate=7 March 2017|quote=And I think particularly in the gay world, and outside the Catholic Church – if that's where some of you want to go with this – I think in the gay world some of the most important, enriching and incredibly life-affirming, important shaping relationships very often between younger boys and older men ...

The company was dissolved shortly after the ceremony that awarded the top start-up.<ref name=Arthur/> Mike Butcher of ''[[TechCrunch]]'' said the main prize had been given to music streaming service [[Spotify]], even though his casting vote had gone to the controversial [[payday loan]] company [[Wonga.com|Wonga]], because the Telegraph considered Wonga's reputation objectionable.<ref name=techcrunch110517>{{cite news|title=Wonga won the Startup 100 awards, not Spotify|url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/05/17/wonga-won-the-startup100-awards-not-spotify|accessdate=15 September 2012|work=TechCrunch Europe|date=17 May 2011}}</ref>

===''The Kernel''===
Together with university friends David Rosenberg and David Haywood Smith, journalist Stephen Pritchard and former ''Telegraph'' employee Adrian McShane, Yiannopoulos launched ''The Kernel'' in November 2011 to "fix European technology journalism."<ref>{{cite news|last=Yiannopoulos|first=Milo|title=It's time to fix European technology journalism|url=http://www.kernelmag.com/editors-blog/145/its-time-to-fix-european-technology-journalism|accessdate=12 September 2012|work=The Kernel|date=10 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715095348/http://www.kernelmag.com/editors-blog/145/its-time-to-fix-european-technology-journalism|archivedate=15 July 2012}}</ref> ''The Kernel'' was at that time owned by Sentinel Media.

In 2012, the online magazine became embroiled in a legal dispute with one of its contributors after he said it failed to pay money owed to him.<ref name=Arthur/> ''The Kernel'' closed in March 2013, with thousands of pounds owed to former contributor Jason Hesse when he won a summary judgement from an employment tribunal against parent company Sentinel Media.

Yiannopoulos also threatened, via email, to release embarrassing details and photographs of a Kernel contributor who sought payment for their work for the site and he also accused the contributor of being behind the "majority of damage to ''The Kernel''". The unnamed contributor told ''The Guardian'' that the emails had been referred to the police.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jan/08/kernel-face-payout-order-contributor|title=The Kernel could face £11,000 payout order|author=Charles Arthur|work=The Guardian|accessdate=25 April 2015}}</ref>

''The Independent on Sunday'' reported that the relaunched publication, based between London and Berlin, would focus on "modern warfare, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, pornography and space travel" from August, but newsletter ''The Nutshell'' would not return.<ref>{{cite news|first=Oscar|last=Williams-Grut|title=The Kernel's back to make new enemies|work=[[The Independent]]|date=2 June 2013|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/the-kernels-back-to-make-new-enemies-8640597.html}}</ref>

Yiannopoulos went on to state that the age of consent is "probably right", when he was subsequently accused of having supported paedophilia.

After being labelled a supporter of paedophilia, Yiannopoulos lost his job, a book deal, and a speaking engagement in CPAC.{{cn|date=August 2017}} 

Yiannopoulos subsequently held a press conference, at which he said he had been the victim of child abuse, and that his comments were a way to cope with it.

Throughout the controversy, Yiannopoulos was criticised for [in his words] attending Hollywood "boat parties" and "house parties" in which boys he described as "very young - ''very'' young" were sexually abused, but failing to report the abusers to the authorities or to identify them during an appearance on ''[[The Joe Rogan Experience]]''.<ref name="duke">{{cite news|last1=Duke|first1=Selwyn|title=Milo’s Seeming Support for Man-Boy Love Is Worse Than the Inaction That Undid Paterno|url=http://observer.com/2017/02/breitbart-milo-yiannopoulos-joe-rogan-podcast-child-sex-abuse|accessdate=22 April 2017|work=Observer|location-New York|date=21 February 2017}}</ref>

On 10 March, an additional video emerged in which Yiannopoulos said that child sexual abuse is "really is not that big of a deal."

Yiannopoulos is a supporter of [[Donald Trump]]. He has been compared to [[Ann Coulter]] and referred to as the "face of a political movement," but he says his real concern is "pop culture and free speech." As he states: "I don’t care about politics, I only talk about politics because of Trump."<ref name="stein"/> 

However, following Trump's decision to [[2017 Shayrat missile strike|attack a Syrian air base]] in April 2017, Yiannopoulos distanced himself from the President, stating that the missile strike was "the opposite of why people voted for him.” This sentiment was shared by a sizeable part of Trump's online supporters including Ann Coulter and [[Mike Cernovich]], who was the first to report on the impending attack.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/online/exclusive-milo-yiannopoulos-breaks-with-trump-on-syria-not-why-people-voted-for-daddy/|title=Milo Yiannopoulos Breaks With Trump on Syria: ‘Not Why People Voted for Daddy’|last=Levine|first=Jon|accessdate=29 April 2017|website=Mediaite.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/04/trump-alt-right-syria-war-214998|title=Trump’s Troll Army Isn’t Ready for War in Syria: The alt-right crowd breaks with the president.|last=Schreckinger|first=Ben|date=7 April 2017|website=Politico.com|access-date=29 August 2017}}</ref>

===Relationship with the alt-right===
Yiannopoulos is commonly associated with the [[alt-right]].<ref name="StandardWhoIs"/><ref name="NoPlatformGuardian"/><ref name="BBC News 21 February 2017"/> In a November 2016 interview with [[Channel 4]], Yiannopoulos talked about his relationship with the movement – "We're fellow travellers on some issues. But I’m very pro-Iraq, I'm very pro-Israel. There are all sorts of points of difference, I think".<ref name="Chan4HtSt">{{cite news|url=https://heatst.com/culture-wars/no-longer-alt-right-milo-distances-himself-from-the-controversial-movement|title=Are You Alt-Right?

In a ''[[Breitbart]]'' article, Yiannopoulos and a co-author described the alt-right movement as "dangerously bright." The ''[[Tablet (magazine)|Tablet]]'' claimed many of these intellectual backers write for publications ''Tablet'' describes as racist and antisemitic, like [[VDARE]] and ''[[American Renaissance (magazine)|American Renaissance]]''.<ref name=Kirchick/> The Breitbart article was criticised by opponents of the alt-right for excusing the extremist elements of the movement, and also by the neo-Nazi website ''[[The Daily Stormer]]'' which holds that racism and antisemitism are pillars of the alt-right.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hankes|first1=Keegan|title=Whose Alt-Right Is It Anyway?|url=https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2016/08/25/whose-alt-right-it-anyway|accessdate=18 September 2016|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|date=25 August 2016}}</ref> Yiannopoulos has said that alt-right hardliners do not like him because he is "a degenerate, race-mixing gay Jew".<ref name=":5"/> 

The [[Anti-Defamation League]] classifies Yiannopoulos as part of the [[alt-lite]]; a term used to distinguish individuals sometimes associated with the alt-right from those who are openly [[white nationalist]] and [[anti-semitic]].<ref name="adl_alt-lite">{{cite web|title=From Alt Right to Alt Lite: Naming the Hate|url=https://www.adl.org/education/resources/backgrounders/from-alt-right-to-alt-lite-naming-the-hate|website=adl.org|publisher=Anti-Defamation League|accessdate=9 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Ziv|first=Stav|url=http://www.newsweek.com/alt-right-or-alt-lite-new-guide-adl-classifies-right-wing-activists-639158|title='Alt-right' or 'alt-lite'?

==Dangerous Faggot Tour==
In late 2015, Yiannopoulos began a campus speaking tour called "The Dangerous Faggot Tour", encompassing universities in the United States and Great Britain. Although most of his American speeches were not cancelled, many were met with notable protest ranging from vocal disruptions to violent demonstrations. The journalist Audrey Goddard analysed his speech at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], concluding that Yiannopoulos spends the "majority of the time voicing his opinions with little to no factual statements accompanying them", which Goddard determined was ironic taking in account how Yiannopoulos repeatedly insisted "that he was just stating 'facts'."<ref name="The Tab Pitt 2016">{{cite news|title=I fact checked Milo Yiannopoulos' speech and it was nonsense|last=Goddard|first=Audrey|work=The Tab Pitt|date=8 April 2016|url=http://thetab.com/us/pitt/2016/04/08/fact-checked-milo-yiannopoulos-speech-nonsense-944|accessdate=29 January 2017}}</ref>

===Rutgers University===
On 9 February 2016, Yiannopoulos spoke at [[Rutgers University]]. At the start of his speech, female protesters stood up among the crowd and began smearing red paint on their faces before chanting "[[Black Lives Matter]]." The mostly pro-Yiannopoulos crowd responded by chanting "[[Donald Trump|Trump]]" over and over again until the protesters left, allowing Yiannopoulos to continue his speech.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/10/rutgers-students-smear-themselves-with-fake-blood-/|last=Chasmar|first=Jessica|title=Rutgers students smear fake blood on themselves to protest Breitbart's Milo Yiannopoulos|work=[[The Washington Times]]|date=10 February 2016|accessdate=20 February 2016}}</ref>

===University of Minnesota===
On 17 February 2016, a student-run conservative magazine at the [[University of Minnesota]] hosted Yiannopolous and [[Christina Hoff Sommers]], and the event was also met by protesters. Roughly 40 protesters outside repeatedly chanted "Yiannopoulos, out of Minneapolis," while about five protesters made it inside the event, shouting and sounding noisemakers, before being escorted out by security.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/protesters-gear-up-for-conservative-pundit-yiannopoulos-at-university-of-minnesota/369157121/#1|title=Conservative pundit draws protesters at University of Minnesota|access-date=3 August 2016}}</ref> In response to these events, members of the university faculty began pushing for more robust free speech protections at Minnesota.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/03/11/top-minnesota-faculty-committee-backs-free-speech-resolution|title=Top Minnesota faculty committee backs free speech resolution|last=Carpenter|first=Dale|date=11 March 2016|work=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=20 February 2017}}</ref>

===DePaul University===
On 24 May 2016 Yiannopoulos's speech at the [[DePaul University]], a Roman Catholic school, was interrupted after about 15 minutes by two protesters who rushed the stage: DePaul alumnus and pastor Edward Ward, and student Kayla Johnson.<ref name="Depaulia1">{{cite news|last1=Moore|first1=Brenden|last2=Kirsten|first2=Onsgard|title=Students call for end to hate speech at Yiannopoulos protest|url=http://depauliaonline.com/2016/05/25/depaul-yiannopoulos-protest-hate-speech|accessdate=15 June 2016|publisher=The DePaulia}}</ref><ref name="Depaulia2">{{cite news|last1=Krupp|first1=Emma|last2=Onsgard|first2=Kirsten|last3=Paras|first3=Matthew|title=Protesters shut down Yiannopoulos speech|url=http://depauliaonline.com/2016/05/24/depaul-protesters-shut-down-yiannopoulos|accessdate=31 January 2017|publisher=The DePaulia}}</ref> 

The crowd overwhelmingly began booing the two protesters, at one point chanting "Get a job." The campus security team that university administrators required the College Republicans to hire the day before (at an extra cost of $1,000, part of which was paid by Yiannopoulos himself), reportedly made no effort to remove the protesters.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/05/28/did-this-professor-resign-rather-than-listen-to-politically-incorrect-speaker.html|title=Trump troll Popularized by PC Mob|last=Soave|first=Robby|date=28 May 2016|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|access-date=20 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2016/05/24/watch-moment-blm-protesters-interrupt-milo-yiannopoulos-event-and-see-how-security-responds|title=Watch Moment BLM Protesters Interrupt Milo Yiannopoulos Event – and See How Security Responds|work=The Blaze|date=24 May 2016}}</ref> This was in addition to further protests outside the event venue both before and after the event, which featured students reacting violently to Yiannopoulos's supporters.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=http://dailycaller.com/2016/05/24/video-depaul-university-descends-into-chaos-over-milo-yiannopoulos-visit|title=DePaul University Descends Into Chaos over Milo Yiannopoulos Visit|last=Neff|first=Blake|date=24 May 2016|via=video|work=[[The Daily Caller]]|access-date=20 February 2017}}</ref>

In the aftermath of the incident, university president [[Dennis H.

===Young Americans for Liberty===
In May 2016 [[Young Americans for Liberty]] (YAL) staffer told chapter leaders that Yiannopoulos' endorsement of Republican presidential candidate at YAL events was creating “confusion” over the non-profit's message. The memo was widely interpreted by chapters as an official ban of Yiannopoulos at YAL events, though YAL quickly disavowed the staffer's comment and said that they do "not ban any speaker."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thecollegefix.com/post/27637/|title=Young Americans for Liberty backtracks after staffer says it has blacklisted Milo Yiannopoulos|last=Schierbecker|first=Mark|date=30 May 2016|work=The College Fix|access-date=29 August 2017}}</ref>

===UCLA===
Yiannopoulos spoke at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] on 31 May 2016 where the event featured an interview-style presentation alongside [[Dave Rubin]] of ''[[The Rubin Report]]''. Prior to the start of the event, protesters formed human chains to block the front door to the theatre where the event was scheduled to take place. 

In response, those who wanted to attend the event were forced to sneak in through the back door, although the protesters also found out about that entrance and attempted to block it as well, subsequently leading to several attendees shoving their way through the crowd to get in. The [[Los Angeles Police Department]] officers on duty then had to prevent protesters from entering while letting attendees pass through, thus delaying the event for about an hour until the room could fill to capacity. Twice during the speech, Yiannopoulos was interrupted by a female protester who shouted "You're spreading hate," and was subsequently booed by the audience; despite seeming to leave after the first outburst, she returned to heckle him again before finally being escorted out of the venue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecollegefix.com/post/27675/|title=Blocked entrance, shouting matches, apathetic cops and angry women at Milo's UCLA stop |work=The College Fix|date=1 June 2016|via=video}}</ref> The next day, it was revealed that the LAPD had come in as the event was ending and told all those still in the theatre that they had to be evacuated due to a bomb threat.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

While carrying a sign "Milo Sucks", he unveiled to "cheers and jeers" and left the protest under police protection unharmed.

Yiannopoulos spoke at the [[University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee]] on 13 December 2016, hosted by [[Turning Point USA]]. President-elect Donald Trump appeared nearby the same day.

More than 300 students and faculty had signed a letter of protest delivered to Mark Mone's office the week before the event. In response, Mone's office issued a statement noting that "UWM does not endorse Yiannopoulos' views" and "no tuition or segregated fee funds are being used to support the event."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wisn.com/article/uw-milwaukee-students-protest-controversial-speaker-scheduled-to-come-to-campus/8476082|title=UW-Milwaukee students protest controversial speaker scheduled to come to campus|work=WISN 12 News|date=8 December 2016}}</ref>

On 1 February 2017, Yiannopoulos was scheduled to make a speech at [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] at 8:00&nbsp;pm. Over 1,500 people gathered to protest the event on the steps of Sproul Hall, with some violence occurring.<ref name="UCBerkeleyNews">{{cite news|title=Milo Yiannopoulos event canceled after violence erupts|url=http://news.berkeley.edu/2017/02/01/yiannopoulos-event-canceled/|accessdate=2 February 2017|work=UC Berkeley News|date=1 February 2017}}</ref>

Yiannopoulos wrote introductions for the 2017 science fiction compilation ''Forbidden Thoughts'' and the [[Vox Day]] non-fiction release ''SJWs Always Lie: Taking Down the Thought Police''. He published two poetry books under the name Milo Andreas Wagner.

An autobiography titled ''Dangerous'' was announced in December 2016. Yiannopoulos has reportedly received a $250,000 advance payment from the book's planned publisher, [[Simon & Schuster]]. It was intended to be published under their [[Threshold Editions]] imprint and to be issued on 14 March 2017, but Yiannopoulos pushed back the schedule to June so he could write about the demonstrations during his campus tour.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/02/simon-schuster-cancels-milo-yiannopoulos-book-170221045200392.html|title=Simon & Schuster cancels Milo Yiannopoulos' book|date=21 February 2017|via=Al Jazeera}}</ref> A day after its announcement, pre-sales for the book elevated it to first place on [[Amazon.com]]'s list of best-sellers.<ref name=Darcy>{{cite web | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/milo-yiannopoulos-book-2016-12|title=Milo Yiannopoulos' just-announced book hits No. 1 on Amazon – here's our Q&A with him|publisher=[[Business Insider]]|date=30 December 2016|accessdate=29 August 2017|last=Darcy|first=Oliver}}</ref>
