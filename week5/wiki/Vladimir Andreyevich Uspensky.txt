'''Vladimir A. Uspensky''' (Russian: Влади́мир Андре́евич Успе́нский; born November 27, 1930, [[Moscow]]) is a Russian [[mathematician]], linguist, writer, doctor of physics and mathematics (1964). He is the author of numerous papers on mathematical logic and linguistics. In addition, he has also penned a number of memoir essays. Uspensky initiated a reform of linguistic education in Russia.

== Biography ==

Uspensky graduated in 1952 from the [[MSU Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics]] [[Moscow State University|(Lomonosov Moscow State University)]]. He was a student of [[Andrey Kolmogorov]]. He is the head of the Chair of Mathematical Logic and Theory of Algorithms in the [[MSU Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics]] (1995) and one of the founders of the Structural Linguistics branch (now the Theoretical and Applied Linguistics branch) in the [[MSU Faculty of Philology]], where he also teaches.
He is the author of many books and of over 100 research papers. He has prepared 25 candidates and 4 doctors of sciences. His book "The Apology of Mathematics" received in 2010 the “Enlightener" award in the field of natural and exact sciences. He is a distinguished professor at the Moscow State University (1998).
His brother [[Boris Uspensky]] is a distinguished Russian philologist and mythographer.
