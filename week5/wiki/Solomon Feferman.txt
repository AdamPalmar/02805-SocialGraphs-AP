'''Solomon Feferman''' (December 13, 1928 – July 26, 2016)<ref>http://www.illc.uva.nl/LogicList/newsitem.php?id=7645</ref> was an American [[philosopher]] and [[mathematician]] with works in [[mathematical logic]]. He was born in The Bronx in New York City from working class parents who had emigrated to the United States after [[World War I]] and had met and married in New York. Neither had any advanced education.  The family moved to Los Angeles, where Feferman graduated from high school at age 16. He received his B.S. from the [[California Institute of Technology]] in 1948 and his Ph.D. in mathematics in 1957 from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] under [[Alfred Tarski]],<ref>{{MathGenealogy|id=19858}}</ref> after being drafted from 1953 to 1955. In 1956 he was hired with appointments in the Departments of Mathematics and Philosophy at [[Stanford University]], where later he became the [[Patrick Suppes]] Professor of Humanities and Sciences.<ref>http://math.stanford.edu/~feferman/</ref>

Feferman was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1972 and 1986<ref>http://www.gf.org/fellows/all-fellows/solomon-feferman/</ref> and the [[Schock Prize]] in logic and philosophy in 2003.<ref>http://news.stanford.edu/news/2003/june4/feferman-64.html</ref> He was invited to deliver the [https://math.berkeley.edu/about/events/lectures/tarski Tarski Lectures] in 2006. In 2012 he became a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].<ref>[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved December 2, 2012.</ref>

Feferman was the editor-in-chief of the five volumes of ''Collected Works'' of [[Kurt Gödel]] that were published by Oxford University Press between 2001 and 2013.

Together with his wife Anita Burdman Feferman, he wrote a biography of Alfred Tarski: ''Alfred Tarski: Life and Logic'' in 2004.

He worked on predicative mathematics, and in particular introduced the [[Feferman–Schütte ordinal]] as a measure of the strength of certain predicative systems.
