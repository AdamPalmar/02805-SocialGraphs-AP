===Epistemology===
Zagzebski is a pioneer in the field of [[virtue epistemology]].<ref>http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-virtue/</ref> In ''Virtues of the Mind'' (1996), she sets out to solve certain problems in modern [[epistemology]] by developing an [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] version of [[virtue theory]], and in the course of this project she lays out a general analysis of virtue. In ''Divine Motivation Theory'' (2004) she deals extensively with problems in the relationship between reason, faith, and ethics.

She has done work on questions of [[epistemic value]] including the "espresso machine" thought experiment (a predecessor to the [[swamping problem]]) as a counter to [[reliabilism]].<ref name="SEPValue">{{Cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/knowledge-value/|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|title=The Value of Knowledge|first1=Duncan|last1=Pritchard|first2=John|last2=Turri}}</ref><ref name="Pritchard-APQ">{{Cite journal|title=Recent Work on Epistemic Value|first=Duncan|last=Pritchard|work=American Philosophical Quarterly|date=April 2007|volume=44|number=2|pages=85–110|jstor=20464361}}</ref>

In her book, ''Epistemic Authority: A Theory of Trust, Authority, and Autonomy in Belief'' (2012), she defends a strong sense of epistemic authority including authority in moral and religious beliefs, and argues that belief on authority is a requirement of intellectual autonomy. This book arose out of her 2010 Wilde lectures at Oxford.
