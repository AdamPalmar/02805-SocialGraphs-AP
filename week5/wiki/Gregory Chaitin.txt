'''Gregory John Chaitin''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|aɪ|t|ɪ|n}} {{respell|CHY|tin}}; born 15 November 1947) <!-- Could we get a more specific place and time? --> is an [[Argentina|Argentine]]-[[United States|American]] [[mathematician]] and [[computer scientist]]. Beginning in the late 1960s, Chaitin made contributions to [[algorithmic information theory]] and [[metamathematics]], in particular a computer-theoretic result equivalent to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]]. He is considered to be one of the founders of what is today known as Kolmogorov (or Kolmogorov-Chaitin) complexity together with [[Andrei Kolmogorov]] and [[Ray Solomonoff]]. Today, [[algorithmic information theory]] is a common subject in any computer science curriculum {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}.

==Mathematics and computer science==
He attended the [[Bronx High School of Science]] and [[City College of New York]], where he (still in his teens) developed the theory that led to his independent discovery of [[Kolmogorov complexity]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Li |last2=Vitanyi |title=An Introduction to Kolmogorov Complexity and Its Applications |publisher=Springer |year=1997 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LKEmB_GQ53QC&printsec=frontcover&hl=en&ved=0CCQQ6AEwAg#v=snippet&f=false |page=92 |quote=G.J.Chaitin had finished the Bronx High School of Science, and was an 18-year-old undergraduate student at City College of the City University of New York, when he submitted two papers.... In his [second] paper, Chaitin puts forward the notion of Kolmogorov complexity.... }}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last=Chaitin |first=G. J. |title=On the Length of Programs for Computing Finite Binary Sequences |journal=Journal of the ACM |volume=13 |issue=4 |date=October 1966 |pages=547–569 |doi=10.1145/321356.321363 }}</ref>

Chaitin has defined [[Chaitin's constant]] Ω, a [[real number]] whose digits are [[normal number|equidistributed]] and which is sometimes informally described as an expression of the probability that a random program will halt. Ω has the mathematical property that it is [[Definable number|definable]] but not [[computability theory (computation)|computable]].

Chaitin's early work on algorithmic information theory followed after the work of [[Solomonoff]], [[Kolmogorov]], and [[Per Martin-Löf|Martin-Löf]].

Chaitin is also the originator of using [[graph coloring]] to do [[register allocation]] in compiling, a process known as [[Chaitin's algorithm]].<ref>G.J. Chaitin, ''Register Allocation and Spilling via Graph Coloring'', [http://www.google.com/patents/US4571678 US Patent 4,571,678] (1986) [cited from [http://ssw.jku.at/Teaching/PhDTheses/Hoflehner/index.html ''Register Allocation on the Intel® Itanium® Architecture''], p.155]</ref>

He was formerly a researcher at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center in New York and remains an emeritus researcher. He has written more than 10 book titles that have been translated to about 15 languages. He is today interested in questions of [[metabiology]] and information-theoretic formalizations of the theory of evolution.

==Other scholarly contributions==
Chaitin also writes about [[philosophy]], especially [[metaphysics]] and [[philosophy of mathematics]] (particularly about epistemological matters in mathematics). In metaphysics, Chaitin claims that [[algorithmic information theory]] is the key to solving problems in the field of [[biology]] (obtaining a formal definition of 'life', its origin and [[evolution]]) and  [[neuroscience]] (the problem of [[consciousness]] and the study of the mind).

In recent writings, he defends a position known as [[digital philosophy]]. In the [[epistemology]] of mathematics, he claims that his findings in [[mathematical logic]] and algorithmic information theory show there are "mathematical facts that are true for no reason, they're true by accident. They are random mathematical facts".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ithistory.org/honor-roll/professor-gregory-john-chaitin|title=Professor Gregory John Chaitin|publisher=[[IT History Society]]|accessdate=2016-07-12}}</ref> Chaitin proposes that mathematicians must abandon any hope of proving those mathematical facts and adopt a [[quasi-empirical]] methodology.

==Honors==
In 1995 he was given the degree of doctor of science ''[[honoris causa]]'' by the [[University of Maine]]. In 2002 he was given the title of honorary professor by the [[University of Buenos Aires]] in Argentina, where his parents were born and where Chaitin spent part of his youth. In 2007 he was given a [[Leibniz Medal (Wolfram Research)|Leibniz Medal]]<ref>Zenil, Hector "Leibniz medallion comes to life after 300 years"
[http://www.mathrix.org/liquid/archives/the-history-of-the-chaitin-leibniz-medallion ''Anima Ex Machina'', The Blog of Hector Zenil], November 3rd, 2007.</ref> by [[Wolfram Research]]. In 2009 he was given the degree of doctor of philosophy ''honoris causa'' by the [[National University of Córdoba]]. He was formerly a researcher at [[IBM]]'s [[Thomas J. Watson Research Center]] and is now a professor at the [[Federal University of Rio de Janeiro]].

==Criticism==
{{criticism section|date=July 2016}}<!--See talk-->
Some philosophers and logicians strongly disagree with the philosophical conclusions that Chaitin has drawn from his theorems.<ref>Panu Raatikainen, "Exploring Randomness and The Unknowable"
[http://www.ams.org/notices/200109/rev-panu.pdf ''Notices'' of the American Mathematical Society] Book Review October 2001.</ref>
The logician [[Torkel Franzén]]<ref>{{Citation |first=Torkel |last=Franzén |authorlink=Torkel Franzén |title=Gödel's Theorem: An Incomplete Guide to its Use and Abuse |location=Wellesley, Massachusetts |publisher=[[A K Peters, Ltd.]] |year=2005 |isbn=1-56881-238-8}}</ref> criticized Chaitin’s interpretation of [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] and the alleged explanation for it that Chaitin’s work represents.
