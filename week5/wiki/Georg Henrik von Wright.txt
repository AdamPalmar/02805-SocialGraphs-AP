==Work==
Von Wright's writings come under two broad categories. The first is [[analytic philosophy]] and [[philosophical logic]] in the Anglo-American vein. His 1951 books, ''An Essay in Modal Logic'' and ''Deontic Logic'', were landmarks in the postwar rise of formal modal logic and its [[deontic logic|deontic]] version. He was an authority on Wittgenstein, editing his later works. He was the leading figure in the Finnish philosophy of his time, specializing in [[philosophical logic]], [[philosophical analysis]], [[philosophy of action]], [[philosophy of language]], [[philosophy of mind]], and the close study of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]].

The other vein in von Wright's writings is moralist and [[pessimism|pessimist]]. During the last twenty years of his life, under the influence of [[Oswald Spengler]], [[Jürgen Habermas]] and the [[Frankfurt School]]'s reflections about modern [[Rationality]], he wrote prolifically. His best known article from this period is entitled ''The Myth of Progress'', and it questions whether our apparent material and technological progress can really be considered "[[progress (history)|progress]]".

In the last year of his life, among his other honorary degrees, he held an [[honorary degree]] at the [[University of Bergen]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Nytt om navn|last=|first=|date=17 January 2002|work=Aftenposten|page=14|language=Norwegian}}</ref>
