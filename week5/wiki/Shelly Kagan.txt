==Philosophy==

Kagan's first book ''The Limits of Morality'' is an extended critique of two key assumptions which underlie what Kagan calls "ordinary morality" - the "common‐sense moral view that most of us accept." Specifically, the book questions the assumption that morality rules out certain actions (such as harming innocent people) even in situations where doing so might create greater good, and the assumption that individuals are "not required to make our greatest possible contribution to the overall good."  According to Kagan, these two assumptions are indefensible, despite their widespread appeal.<ref name=Clark/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/0198239165.001.0001|title=The Limits of Morality|publisher=}}</ref>

In 1997, Kagan published a textbook titled ''Normative Ethics,'' designed to provide a thorough introduction to the subject for upper-level undergraduate or graduates students.<ref name="yale.edu">{{cite web|url=http://campuspress.yale.edu/shellykagan/books/|title=Books - Shelly Kagan|publisher=}}</ref> In the spring of 2007, his Yale course "Death" was recorded for [[Open Yale Courses]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oyc.yale.edu/philosophy/phil-176|title=Open Yale Courses - Death|publisher=}}</ref> and the book ''Death'' is based on these lectures.<ref name="yale-page"/> In 2010, Yale University reported Kagan's "Death" course had made him one of the most popular foreign teachers in China.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kagan’s ‘Death’ class has made him a ‘star’ in China|url=http://news.yale.edu/2010/10/06/kagan-s-death-class-has-made-him-star-china|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref>
