'''Jay Frank Rosenberg''' (April 18, 1942 in [[Chicago]] IL – February 21, 2008 in [[Chapel Hill NC]]) was a Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]. He was a  student of [[Wilfrid Sellars]] and established his reputation with ten books and over 80 articles in metaphysics, epistemology, the philosophy of language, and the history of philosophy (especially [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]). His most commercially successful work, ''The Practice of Philosophy: A Handbook for Beginners'', is a standard text in introductory philosophy courses, and has been translated into German.

Rosenberg's first publication, ''The Impoverished Students' Book of Cookery, Drinkery, and Housekeepery!'', written while an undergraduate at [[Reed College]], has since been republished and is available from the Reed College bookstore.  Also while at Reed, Rosenberg was a keen observer and commenter of the tabletop game ''Empire'', though he never played.

In 1966, Rosenberg appeared as himself on the May 9, 1966 episode of [[To Tell The Truth]] where he was introduced, along with two imposters as the author ''The Impoverished Students' Book of Cookery, Drinkery, and Housekeepery!''.  [[Tom Poston]] was the only panelist to correctly identify Rosenberg.<ref>{{cite web|last1=CBS Television|title=To Tell the Truth|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSxQ3_mqutQ|website=You Tube|accessdate=10 September 2017}}</ref>
