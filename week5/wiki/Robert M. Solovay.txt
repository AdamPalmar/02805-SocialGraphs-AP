'''Robert Martin Solovay''' (born December 15, 1938) is an [[United States|American]] [[mathematician]] specializing in [[set theory]].

==Biography==
Solovay earned his [[Ph.D.]] from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1964 under the direction of [[Saunders Mac Lane]], with a dissertation on ''A Functorial Form of the Differentiable [[Riemann–Roch theorem]]''.<ref>{{MathGenealogy|id=6522}}</ref> Solovay has spent his career at the [[University of California]] at Berkeley, where his Ph.D. students include [[W. Hugh Woodin]] and [[Matthew Foreman]].<ref>https://math.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/robert-m-solovay</ref>

==Work==
Solovay's theorems include:
* [[Solovay's theorem]] showing that, if one assumes the existence of an [[inaccessible cardinal]], then the statement "every [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of [[real number]]s is [[Lebesgue measurable]]" is consistent with [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF]] without the [[axiom of choice]];
* Isolating the notion of [[zero sharp|0<sup>#</sup>]];
* Proving that the existence of a [[measurable cardinal#Real-valued measurable|real valued measurable cardinal]] is [[equiconsistency|equiconsistent]] with the existence of a measurable cardinal;
* Proving that if <math>\lambda</math> is a strong limit [[singular cardinal]], greater than a [[strongly compact cardinal]] then <math>2^\lambda=\lambda^+</math> holds;
* Proving that if <math>\kappa</math> is an uncountable regular cardinal, and <math>S\subseteq\kappa</math> is a [[stationary set]], then <math>S</math> can be decomposed into the union of <math>\kappa</math> disjoint stationary sets;
* With [[Stanley Tennenbaum]], developing the method of iterated forcing and showing the consistency of [[Suslin's hypothesis]].
* Outside of set theory, developing (with [[Volker Strassen]]) the [[Solovay–Strassen primality test]], used to identify large [[natural number]]s that are [[prime number|prime]] with high [[probability]]. This method has had implications for [[cryptography]].
* Proving that GL (the [[normal modal logic]] which has the instances of the schema <math>\Box(\Box A\to A)\to\Box A</math> as additional axioms) completely axiomatizes the logic of the provability predicate of [[Peano Arithmetic]].
* With [[Alexei Kitaev]], proving that a finite set of [[Quantum gate|quantum gates]] can efficiently approximate an arbitrary [[unitary operator]] on one [[qubit]].
