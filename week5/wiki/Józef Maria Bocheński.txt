'''Józef Maria Bocheński''' ([[Czuszów]], [[Congress Poland]], [[Russian Empire]], 30 August 1902 – 8 February 1995, [[Fribourg]], [[Switzerland]]) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[Dominican Order|Dominican]], [[logician]] and [[philosopher]].

==Life==
After taking part in the 1920 campaign against aggression of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]], he took up legal studies in [[Lwów]], then studied economics in [[Poznań]]. Bocheński earned a doctorate in philosophy (he studied in [[Freiburg]], 1928–31).  He was also an [[List of people associated with the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas|alumnus]] of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] in [[Rome]] where he studied [[Sacred Theology]] from 1931 to 1934 earning a doctorate in Sacred Theology. Bocheński was a professor of logic at the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|''Angelicum'']] until 1940.

During [[World War II]] he served as chaplain to Polish forces during the 1939 [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion of Poland]], was taken [[prisoner of war]], escaped the Germans and reached [[Rome]]. He joined the Polish Army and served as chaplain first in [[France]], then in [[England]]. He fought as a soldier in 1944 in the Italian campaign of the [[Polish II Corps]] at [[Monte Cassino]].

In 1945 he received the chair in the history of twentieth-century philosophy at the [[University of Fribourg]] (of which he was [[Rector (academia)|rector]] in 1964-66); he founded and ran the Institute of Eastern Europe there, and published the journal ''Studies in Soviet Thought'' and a book series concerned with the foundations of Marxist philosophy (''Sovietica'').

Bocheński served as consultant to several governments: West Germany (under [[Konrad Adenauer]]), South Africa, the United States, Argentina, and Switzerland.

Before 1989 none of his works were published officially in [[Poland]].

==The Cracow Circle==
Bocheński is perhaps the most famous exponent of the Cracow Circle, which has been called "the most significant expression of Catholic thought between the two World Wars."<ref>http://segr-did2.fmag.unict.it/~polphil/polphil/Cracow/Cracow.html  Accessed 15 March 2013</ref> The Circle was founded by a group of [[Analytical Thomism|philosophers]] and theologians that, in distinction from traditional neo-Thomism, embraced modern formal logic and it applied to traditional Thomist philosophy and theology.<ref>http://segr-did2.fmag.unict.it/~polphil/polphil/Cracow/Cracow.html  Accessed 15 March 2013</ref> Inspired by the logical clarity of Aquinas, members of the Circle held both philosophy and theology to contain "propositions with truth-values…a structured body of propositions connected in meaning and subject matter, and linked by logical relations of compatibility and incompatibility, entailment etc."  "The Cracow Circle set about investigating and where possible improving this logical structure with the most advanced logical tools available at the time, namely those of modern mathematical logic, then called ‘logistic’." <ref>" Bocheński and Balance: System and History in Analytic Philosophy", Peter Simons, Studies in East European Thought 55 (2003), 281–297, Reprinted in: Edgar Morscher, Otto Neumaier and Peter Simons, Ein Philosoph mit "Bodenhaftung": Zu Leben und Werk von Joseph M. Bocheński. St.Augustin: Academia, 2011, 61–79</ref>  Other members of the Circle included [[:pl:Jan Salamucha|Jan Salamucha ]] and Jan F. Drewnowski.

== The logical hexagon for the square of opposition ==
[[Robert Blanché]] quoted a passage of Bochenski’s ''Formale Logik'' in ''Structure intellectuelles'' (1966, 39): "Hindu logic knows of three logical propositions and not the four of western logic. For it ''Some S are P'' does not signify ''Some S at least are P'' but ''Some S are P but not all''." This passage shows that Indian tradition explicitly speaks of the existence of partial quantity, the third quantity to be considered along with totality apprehended by A the universal affirmative of the square, and zero quantity apprehended by E the universal negative of the square. To the two universals A and E entertaining a relationship of contrariety, one should add the third contrary constituted by the double negation of the first two. As the subcontrary I contradicts E and the subcontrary O contradicts A, the logical proposition apprehending partial quantity can be represented by the conjunction of I and O : I & O. In Blanché’s [[logical hexagon]] this conjunction is symbolized by the letter Y. Many scholars{{who|date=July 2014}} think that the logical [[square of opposition]], representing four values, should be replaced by the logical hexagon, which has the power to express more relations of opposition.
