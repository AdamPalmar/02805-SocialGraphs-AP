'''Richard Carl Jeffrey''' (August 5, 1926 – November 9, 2002) was an [[United States|American]] [[philosopher]], [[logician]], and [[probability theory|probability theorist]]. He is best known for developing and championing the philosophy of [[radical probabilism]] and the associated heuristic of [[probability kinematics]], also known as Jeffrey conditioning.

==Life and work==
Born in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], Jeffrey served in the [[U.S. Navy]] during [[World War II]]. As a graduate student he studied under [[Rudolf Carnap]], and [[Carl Hempel]].<ref>{{cite web|last= Jeffrey|first=Richard|title=A Proposal to the National Science Foundation for Support of Research on Carnap's Inductive Logic| url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/u/ulsmanuscripts/pdf/31735062223890.pdf|work=Richard Jeffery's Papers|publisher=Special Collections Department, University of Pittsburgh|accessdate=September 17, 2013 }}</ref> He received his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1952 and his [[Ph.D.]] from [[University of Princeton|Princeton]] in 1957. After holding academic positions at [[MIT]], [[City College of New York]], [[Stanford University]], and the [[University of Pennsylvania]], he joined the faculty of Princeton in 1974 and became a professor [[emeritus]] there in 1999. He was also a visiting professor at the [[University of California, Irvine]].<ref>{{ cite web | url=https://philosophy.princeton.edu/about/past-faculty/richard-c-jeffrey | author=Princeton University Department of Philosophy | accessdate=July 11, 2017 | title=Richard C. Jeffrey}}</ref>

As a philosopher, Jeffrey specialized in [[epistemology]] and [[decision theory]]. He is perhaps best known for defending and developing the [[Bayesianism|Bayesian]] approach to probability.

Jeffrey also wrote, or co-wrote, two widely used and influential [[logic]] textbooks: ''Formal Logic: Its Scope and Limits'', a basic introduction to logic, and ''Computability and Logic'', a more advanced text dealing with, among other things, the famous negative results of twentieth century logic such as [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] and [[Tarski's indefinability theorem]].

Jeffrey, who died of [[lung cancer]] at the age of 76, was known for his sense of humor, which often came through in his breezy writing style. In the preface of his posthumously published ''Subjective Probability'', he refers to himself as "a fond foolish old fart dying of a surfeit of [[Pall Mall (cigarette)|Pall Malls]]".<ref>''p''xii</ref>

==Radical probabilism==
{{main|Radical probabilism}}
In [[frequentist statistics]], [[Bayes' theorem]] provides a useful rule for updating a probability when new frequency data becomes available. In Bayesian statistics, the theorem itself plays a more limited role. Bayes' theorem connects probabilities that are held simmultaneously. It does not tell the learner how to update probabilities when new evidence becomes available over time. This subtelty was first pointed out in terms by [[Ian Hacking]] in 1967.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Hacking|first=Ian|title=Slightly more realistic personal probability| journal=Philosophy of Science|volume=34|pages=311–325|year=1967 }}</ref>

However, adapting Bayes' theorem, and adopting it as a rule of updating, is a temptation. Suppose that a learner forms probabilities ''P''<sub>old</sub>(''A''&''B'')=''p'' and ''P''<sub>old</sub>(''B'')=''q''.
If the learner subsequently learns that ''B'' is true, nothing in the axioms or probability or the results derived therefrom tells him how to behave. He might be tempted to adopt Bayes' theorem by analogy and set his ''P''<sub>new</sub>(''A'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''P''<sub>old</sub>(''A''&nbsp;|&nbsp;''B'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''p''/''q''.

In fact, that step, Bayes' rule of updating, can be justified, as necessary and sufficient, through a ''dynamic'' [[Dutch book]] argument that is additional to the arguments used to justify the axioms. This argument was first put forward by [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]] in the 1970s though he never published it.<ref>{{cite journal|year=1987|last= Skyrms|first=Brian|title=Dynamic coherence and probability kinematics| journal=Philosophy of Science|volume=54|page=1–20 }}</ref>

That works when the new data is certain. [[C. I. Lewis]] had argued that "If anything is to be probable then something must be certain".<ref>{{ cite book | last=Lewis | first=C. I. | year=1946 | title=An Analysis of Knowledge and Valuation | location=La Salle, Illinois | publisher=Open Court| page=186 }}</ref> There must, on Lewis' account, be some certain facts on which probabilities were [[conditional probability|conditioned]]. However, the principle known as [[Cromwell's rule]] declares that nothing, apart form a logical law, can ever be certain, if that. Jeffrey famously rejected Lewis' ''dictum'' and quipped, "It's probabilities all the way down." He called this position ''radical probabilism''.

In this case Bayes' rule isn't able to capture a mere subjective change in the probability of some critical fact. The new evidence may not have been anticipated or even be capable of being articulated after the event. It seems reasonable, as a starting position, to adopt the [[law of total probability]] and extend it to updating in much the same way as was Bayes' theorem.<ref>{{ cite journal | last=Jeffrey | first=Richard | year=1987 | title=Alias Smith and Jones: The testimony of the senses | journal=Erkenntnis| volume=26 | pages=391–399}}</ref>

: ''P''<sub>new</sub>(''A'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''P''<sub>old</sub>(''A''&nbsp;|&nbsp;''B'')''P''<sub>new</sub>(''B'')&nbsp;+&nbsp;''P''<sub>old</sub>(''A''&nbsp;|&nbsp;not-''B'')''P''<sub>new</sub>(not-''B'')

Adopting such a rule is sufficient to avoid a Dutch book but not necessary.<ref>Skyrms (1987)</ref>. Jeffrey advocated this as a rule of updating under radical probabilism and called it probability kinematics. Others have named it Jeffrey conditioning.

It is not the only sufficient updating rule for radical probabilism. Others have been advocated including [[E. T. Jaynes]]' [[maximum entropy principle]] and [[Brian Skyrms]]' [[principle of reflection]].
