'''Edward Nelson''' (May 4, 1932 – September 10, 2014) was a professor in the Mathematics Department at [[Princeton University]]. He was known for his work on [[mathematical physics]] and [[mathematical logic]].  In mathematical logic, he was noted especially for his [[internal set theory]], and views on [[ultrafinitism]] and the [[consistency]] of [[Peano arithmetic|arithmetic]]. In [[philosophy of mathematics]] he advocated the view of [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalism]] rather than [[Platonism (mathematics)|platonism]] or [[intuitionism]]. He also wrote on the relationship between religion and mathematics.

==Biography==
Born in [[Decatur, Georgia]], in 1932, Nelson lived in [[Italy]] as a child under the dictatorship of [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]. Nelson moved with his mother to [[New York City]] before [[World War II]] while his father, who spoke fluent [[Russian language|Russian]], stayed in [[St. Petersburg]] in connection with issues related to [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]. After the war he returned to Italy for high school.

He received his Ph.D. in 1955 from the [[University of Chicago]], where he worked with [[Irving Segal]]. He was a member of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] from 1956 to 1959.  He held a position at [[Princeton University]] starting in 1959, attaining the rank of professor there in 1964 and retiring in 2013.

In 2012 he became a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].{{sfn|AMS|2012}} He died in [[Princeton, New Jersey]] on September 10, 2014.{{sfn|Princeton University|2014}}

==Academic work==
===Stochastic quantum mechanics===
{{main article|Stochastic quantum mechanics}}
Nelson made contributions to the theory of infinite-dimensional [[group representation]]s, the mathematical treatment of [[quantum field theory]], the use of [[stochastic process]]es in [[quantum mechanics]], and the reformulation of [[probability theory]] in terms of [[non-standard analysis]].For many years he worked on [[mathematical physics]] and probability theory, and he retained a residual interest in these fields, particularly in connection with possible extensions of stochastic mechanics to [[field theory (physics)|field theory]].

===Four color problem===
{{main article|Hadwiger–Nelson problem|Four color theorem}}
In 1950, Nelson formulated a popular variant of the [[four color problem]]: What is the chromatic number, denoted <math>\chi</math>, of the plane? In more detail, what is the smallest number of colors sufficient for coloring the points of the Euclidean plane such that no two points of the same color are unit distance apart?{{sfn|Soifer|2009|p=23}} We know by simple arguments that 4&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''χ''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;7. The problem was introduced to a wide mathematical audience by [[Martin Gardner]] in his October 1960 [[Mathematical Games]] column. The chromatic number problem, also now known as the [[Hadwiger–Nelson problem]], was a favorite of [[Paul Erdős]], who mentioned it frequently in his problems lectures.

===Foundations of mathematics===
{{main article|Foundations of mathematics}}
In the later part of his career, he worked on mathematical logic and the foundations of mathematics. One of his goals was to extend IST ([[Internal Set Theory]]—a version of a portion of [[Abraham Robinson]]'s [[non-standard analysis]]) in a natural manner that includes external functions and sets, in a way that provides an external function with specified properties unless there is a finitary obstacle to its existence. Other work centered on fragments of arithmetic, studying the divide between those theories interpretable in [[Robinson arithmetic|Raphael Robinson's Arithmetic]] and those that are not; [[computational complexity theory|computational complexity]], including the problem of whether [[P = NP problem|P is equal to NP or not]]; and automated proof checking.

In September 2011, Nelson announced that he had proved that [[Peano arithmetic]] was logically inconsistent.{{sfn|Nelson|2011}} An error was found in the proof, and he retracted the claim.{{sfn|Baez|2011}}
