'''Bjarni Jónsson''' (February 15, 1920 – September 30, 2016)<ref>{{cite book|title=American Men & Women of Science - Volume 4|year=2009|publisher=R.R. Bowker Company. Database Publishing Group|isbn=0787665274|page=148}}</ref> was an Icelandic [[mathematician]] and [[logician]] working in [[universal algebra]], [[lattice theory]], [[model theory]] and [[set theory]]. He was [[emeritus]] [[Distinguished Professor]] of [[Mathematics]] at [[Vanderbilt University]] and the honorary editor in chief of ''[[Algebra Universalis]]''. He received his PhD in 1946 at [[UC Berkeley]] under supervision of [[Alfred Tarski]].<ref>{{MathGenealogy|id=19851}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2016/10/12/noted-algebraist-bjarni-jonsson-dies/|title=Noted algebraist Bjarni Jónsson dies|first=David|last=Salisbury|work=vanderbilt.edu|accessdate=14 October 2016}}</ref>

[[subdirectly irreducible algebra#JonssonsLemma|Jónsson's Lemma]] as well as several mathematical objects are named after him, among them [[Jónsson algebra]]s, ω-[[Jónsson function]]s, [[Jónsson cardinal]]s, [[Jónsson term]]s, [[Jónsson–Tarski algebra]]s and [[General frame|Jónsson–Tarski duality]].

In 2012, he became a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].<ref>[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2013-01-26.</ref>
