'''Israr Ahmed''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|ڈاکٹر اسرار احمد}}}}; 26 April 1932 – 14 April 2010; Msc, [[MBBS]]) was a prominent Pakistani [[Islamic theologian]],<ref name="tanzeem.org">{{cite web|url=http://tanzeem.info/webapps/tip_dnnweb/Organization/TheFounder.aspx |title=About the Founder:Dr. Israr Ahmad |publisher=Tanzeem.org |date= |accessdate=22 March 2016}}</ref> [[Islamic philosophy|philosopher]],<ref name="Grand Strategic review">{{cite web|last=Hashmi|first=Salima|title=On the Philosophy of Dr. Israr Ahmed|url=http://www.grandestrategy.com/2010/04/on-philosophy-of-dr-israr-ahmed.html|publisher=Grand Strategic review|accessdate=15 March 2013}}</ref> and [[Islamic scholar]]<ref name="Dawn Archives, April 15th, 2010">{{cite news|last=Our Staff Reporter|title=Prominent scholar Dr Israr Ahmed dies|url=http://archives.dawn.com/archives/43760|accessdate=15 March 2013|newspaper=Dawn Archives, 15 April 2010|date=15 April 2010}}</ref> who was followed particularly in South Asia as well as by South Asian Muslims in the Middle East, Western Europe, and North America.<ref name="Dr.IA">[http://islam.islamabad.net/ islamabad.net, "Dr. Israr Ahmed"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329114424/http://islam.islamabad.net/ |date=29 March 2008 }}</ref>

He was the founder of the [[Tanzeem-e-Islami]] and an offshoot activist of the rightist [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]].<ref name="Dawn Archives, April 15th, 2010"/> Ahmed wrote and published 60 books on different aspects of Islam and religion, nine of which were translated into English.<ref name="Dawn Archives, April 15th, 2010"/> Prior to that, he was a television personality and daily hosted a religious show on [[Peace TV]].

==Early life and education==

Israr Ahmed was born in [[Hisar (city)|Hisar]], a province of [[Punjab Province (British India)|East Punjab]] of [[British Indian Empire]], on 26 April 1932.<ref name="Peace TV promotion">{{cite web|last=Peace TV|title=Dr. Israr Ahmad|url=http://www.peacetv.tv/en-gb/speakers/dr-israr-ahmed|publisher=Peace TV promotion|accessdate=15 March 2013}}</ref> His father was a [[Indian Civil Service|civil servant]] in the [[British Government]]<ref name="Peace TV promotion"/> and had his family settled from Hisar to [[Montgomery (Pakistan)|Montgomery]], now [[Sahiwal]], [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab Province]] of Pakistan.<ref name="tanzeem.org"/><ref name="Peace TV promotion"/>

After graduating from a local high school, Ahmed moved to [[Lahore]] to attend the [[King Edward Medical University]] in 1950.<ref name="Dawn Archives, April 15th, 2010"/> He received his [[MBBS]] from [[King Edward Medical University]] in 1954 and began practising medicine.<ref name="Dawn Archives, April 15th, 2010"/>

In 1950, he joined [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]] led by [[Abul Ala Maududi]], but left the party when the latter opted for participating in electoral politics in 1957. Ahmed resigned from the Jamaat-e-Islami in April 1957 because of its involvement in the [[Politics of Pakistan|national politics]], which he believed was irreconcilable with the revolutionary methodology adopted by the Jama'at in the pre-1947 period.<ref name="Dr.IA"/> His interest in Islam and philosophy grew further and he subsequently moved to [[Karachi]], [[Sindh Province]] in the 1960s where he enrolled in [[Karachi University]]. After submitting his thesis in 1965, he earned his MSc in [[Islamic Studies]] from Karachi University.<ref name="Dawn Archives, April 15th, 2010"/>

==Work==

===Literature and philosophy===

In 1967, Ahmed wrote and published the important philosophy book, ''Islamic Renaissance: The Real Task Ahead'', in which he briefly explained the abstract idea of the [[caliphate]] system. He vehemently maintained that only by revitalising [[Iman (concept)|Iman]] and importance of faith among the Muslims in general and intelligentsia in particular. His solution was to teach Qur'an in contemporary idiom backed by the highest level of scholarship. Commenting on scientific aspects, Ahmed wrote that "this undertaking would remove the existing dichotomy between modern physical and social sciences on the one hand, and Islamic revealed knowledge on the other."

He criticised modern democracy and the prevalent electoral system and argued that the head of an Islamic state could reject the majority decisions of an elected assembly.<ref>Mumtaz Ahmad, "Media-Based Preachers and the Creation of New Muslim Publics in Pakistan," NBR Special Report 22, February 2010 [http://nbr.org/publications/specialreport/pdf/SR22.pdf]</ref> Although he did not like to receive it personally, Ahmed was awarded the [[Sitara-i-Imtiaz]] in 1981. He has to his credit over 60 books in Urdu on topics related to Islam and Pakistan, nine of which have been translated into English and other languages.<ref name="tanzeem.org"/>

== Health ==
Ahmed relinquished the leadership of Tanzeem-e-Islami in October 2002 on grounds of bad health and Hafiz Akif Saeed is the present Ameer of the Tanzeem to whom all rufaqaa of Tanzeem renewed their pledge of Baiyah.<ref name="TanzeemAmeer">{{cite web|url=http://tanzeem.info/webapps/tip_dnnweb/Organization/TheAmeer.aspx |title=Biography of Ameer Tanzeem-e-Islami Hafiz Akif Saeed |publisher=Tanzeem.org |accessdate=22 March 2016}}</ref>

==Influences==
Like [[Wahiduddin Khan]], [[Naeem Siddiqui]] and [[Javed Ahmad Ghamidi]], Ahmed also worked closely with Maulana Syed Abul Ala Maududi (alternative spelling Syed Maudoodi; often referred to as Maulana Maududi) (1903–1979). Supporters describe his vision of Islam as having been synthesised from the diverse sources. He has also acknowledged the "deep influence" of Shah Waliullah Dehlavi, the 18th century Indian Islamic leader, anti-colonial activist, jurist, and scholar.<ref name="KhilafaPerson">{{cite web|url=http://www.khilafahmovement.org/israrahmed.htm |title=The Khilafah Movement Famous Personalities |publisher=Khilafahmovement.org |date=26 April 1932 |accessdate=26 November 2011}}</ref> 

"In the context of Qur'anic exegesis and understanding, Ahmed was a firm traditionalist of the genre of Maulana Mehmood Hassan Deobandi and Allama Shabbir Ahmed Usmani; yet he presented Qur'anic teachings in a scientific and enlightened way".<ref name="Dr.IA"/>
Ahmed believed in what he called "Islamic revolutionary thought," which consists of the idea that Islam &ndash; the teachings of the Qur'an and the [[Sunnah]] &ndash; must be implemented in the social, cultural, juristic, political, and economic spheres of life. In this he is said to follow [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=5E18C5D30C2E7750831E3910D8F492A3.tomcat1?fromPage=online&aid=3422096# Mohammad Rafiuddin] and [[Muhammad Iqbal]]. The first attempt towards the actualisation of this concept was reportedly made by Maulana Abul Kalam Azad through his short-lived party, the Hizbullah. Another attempt was made by Maulana Sayyid [[Abul Ala Maududi]] through his Jamaat-e-Islami party. Although the Jamaat-e-Islami has reached some influence, Ahmed resigned from the party in 1956 when it entered the electoral process and believed that such an involvement led to "degeneration from a pure Islamic revolutionary party to a mere political one".<ref name="TanzeemHistory">{{cite web|url=http://tanzeem.info/webapps/tip_dnnweb/Organization/Background.aspx |title=Background/History of Tanzeem-e-Islami |publisher=Tanzeem.org |date= |accessdate=22 March 2016}}</ref>

==Tanzeem-e-Islami==
Originally a member of [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]], Ahmed became disappointed with its electoral activity, "significant policy matters", and what he saw as the "lack of effort to create an Islamic renaissance through the revolutionary process."  He and some other individuals resigned from JI and in 1956 founded the nucleus of Tanzeem-e-Islami, an attempt to create a "disciplined organization." "A resolution was passed which subsequently became the Mission Statement of Tanzeem-e-Islami."<ref name="Dr.IA"/>

Along with his work to revive "the Qur'an-centered Islamic perennial philosophy and world-view" Ahmed aimed with his party to "reform the society in a practical way with the ultimate objective of establishing a true Islamic State, or the System of [[Caliphate|Khilafah]]".<ref name="tanzeem.org"/>

===Hizb ut-Tahrir===
According to Tanzeem-e-Islami's FAQ, while both [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] and Tanzeem-e-Islami share belief in reviving the Caliphate as a means of implementing Islam in all spheres of life, Tanzeem-e-Islami does not believe in involvement in electoral politics, armed struggle, coup d'état to establish a caliphate, and has no set plan of detailed workings for the future Caliphate. Tanzeem-e-Islami emphasises that iman (faith) among Muslims must be revived in "a significant portion of the Muslim society" before there can be an Islamic revival.<ref name="tanzeemFAQ">{{cite web|url=http://tanzeem.info/webapps/tip_dnnweb/FAQs.aspx |title=Tamzeem-e-Islami Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Tanzeem.org |accessdate=22 March 2016}}</ref>

===Abul Ala Maududi===
While Ahmed "considers himself a product" of the teachings of "comprehensive and holistic concept of the Islamic obligations" of [[Abul Ala Maududi]], he opposes Jamaat-e-Islami's "plunge" into "the arena of power politics," which he considered to have been "disastrous."<ref name="tanzeemFAQ"/>

===Danger of foreign powers===
{{Main|2011 NATO attack in Pakistan|2011 India-Pakistan border shooting|2008 Mumbai attacks}}
In response to the [[2007 Pakistani state of emergency|state of emergency]] in 2007, Ahmed called for lifting the emergency, reinstatement of [[Supreme Court of Pakistan|Supreme Court]] [[List of Justices of the Supreme Court of Pakistan|justices]], and withdrawal of all actions taken in pursuance of the proclamation of emergency and the [[Provisional Constitutional Order|PCO law]] besides resignation of [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Pervez Musharraf]].<ref name="Dawn News Archives 2007"/>

In a televised press conference, Ahmed called for resignation of [[Pervez Musharraf]] from both [[President of Pakistan|president]] and [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|chief of army staff]].<ref name="Dawn News Archives 2007"/> Ahmed appealed to President General Musharraf to lift the state emergency and step down for the nation's greater interests.<ref name="Dawn News Archives 2007"/> At the television news channels, Ahmed also predicted and warned the nation that:

==Criticism and controversy==

In 2006 Canada's ''[[National Post]]'' newspapers quoted Ahmed as saying: <blockquote>"Islam's renaissance will begin in Pakistan... because the Arab world is living under subjugation. Only the Pakistan region
has the potential for standing up against the nefarious designs of the global power-brokers and to resist the rising tides of the Jewish/Zionist hegemony.<ref name="investigativeproject.org">[http://www.investigativeproject.org/article/539 "FBI's Latest Outreach Outrage", by [[Steven Emerson]], IPT News, 7 November 2007]</ref></blockquote>

''Asia Times'' reports that in September 1995 Ahmed told the annual convention of the Islamic Society of North America that:
<blockquote> The process of the revival of Islam in different parts of the world is real. A final showdown between the Muslim world and the non-Muslim world, which has been captured by the Jews, would soon take place. The Gulf War was just a rehearsal for the coming conflict.</blockquote>  He appealed to the Muslims of the world, including those in the US, to prepare themselves for the coming conflict."<ref name="atimes.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/EG03Df07.html |title="Al-Qaeda clone takes root in the US," by B Raman, July 3, 2003 |publisher=Atimes.com |date=3 July 2003 |accessdate=26 November 2011}}</ref>
