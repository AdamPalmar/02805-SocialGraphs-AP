During World War II, he worked as a speaker on [[BBC World Service|Radio London]], and was known as "London's Slovene voice". He served as a Minister in the [[Treaty of Vis|Tito–Šubašić coalition government]]. In 1947, he was convicted by the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Communist]] authorities at the [[Nagode Trial]].

==Early life and career==
He was born in a middle class [[Slovenes|Slovene]] family in [[Trieste]], then part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] (today in Italy). He attended private [[Slovene language]] schools in Trieste. As a teenager, he attended an intensive English course at the local [[Berlitz Language Schools|Berlitz language school]], where he was a pupil of the Irish novelist [[James Joyce]].<ref>[[Richard Ellmann]], ''[[James Joyce (biography)|James Joyce]]'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1982), p. 341</ref><ref>[[Marta Verginella]], ''Il confine degli altri: la questione giuliana e la memoria slovena'' (Rome: Donzelli Editore, 2008), p. 36</ref> After finishing the [[German language]] [[Gymnasium (school)|State gymnasium]] in Trieste in 1913, he went to study law at the [[University of Paris]].<ref>Marta Verginella, ''Il confine degli altri: la questione giuliana e la memoria slovena'' (Rome: Donzelli Editore, 2008), p. 36</ref> After the break of [[World War I]], he returned to Austria-Hungary, and enrolled in the [[University of Vienna]]. He finished his studies at the [[University of Bologna]] after the end of World War I. In 1920, he obtained a PhD from the [[University of Zagreb]].

In 1920, Furlan returned to his home city of Trieste, which had become a part of the [[Kingdom of Italy]]. First, he worked as an assistant in the [[Josip Wilfan]]'s law firm, establishing his own practice in 1925. In 1926, when [[Fascist Italianization]] was already in full advance, he managed to get a permit to publish a Slovene-language legal journal named ''Pravni vestnik'' (The Legal Herald), in which both Furlan and Wilfan published numerous text on legal philosophy and legal theory.<ref>Marta Verginella, ''Il confine degli altri: la questione giuliana e la memoria slovena'' (Rome: Donzelli Editore, 2008), p. 37</ref> The journal was abolished in 1928, as one of the last Slovene-language and Croat-language media prohibited by the Fascist regime. Between 1928 and 1930, Furlan worked as political advisor to Wilfan, who became one of the leaders of the [[Congress of European Nationalities]].<ref>[http://www2.arnes.si/~ljinz15/documents/english/prispevki/prispevki_00-1.htm www2.arnes.si]</ref>

In 1930, he escaped to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] in order to escape [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] persecution. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} In 1931, he opened a law practice in [[Ljubljana]], and in 1936 he became a professor of sociology of law at the [[University of Ljubljana]]. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Exile during World War II==
In late March 1941, when Yugoslavia signed the [[Tripartite Pact]], Furlan was evacuated from the country with the help of the British intelligence service with which he had established a collaboration.<ref>[http://www.rtvslo.si/odprtikop/intervju/dr-janez-arnez/ www.rtvslo.si] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609172844/http://www.rtvslo.si/odprtikop/intervju/dr-janez-arnez/ |date=2011-06-09 }}</ref> After the [[Axis invasion of Yugoslavia]] and the [[Province of Ljubljana|Italian occupation of Slovenia]], he was convicted to death ''[[trial in absentia|in contumaciam]]'' by the Italian authorities. After a short stay in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], Furlan travelled to the [[United States]]. Together with the [[liberal conservative]] Slovenian émigré politicians [[Izidor Cankar]] and [[Franc Snoj]], Furlan propagated for the Yugoslav and Slovene cause. In 1942, he published a brochure titled ''Fighting Yugoslavia: The Struggle of the Slovenes'', in which he articulated, among other, the Slovenian claims for the annexation of his native [[Julian March]] region to Yugoslavia. {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In 1943, he moved to London, where he served as Minister of Education in the [[exile government]] of [[Miloš Trifunović]] between June and August 1943. In the first years of the war, Furlan supported the [[Chetnik]] resistance movement of [[Draža Mihajlović]], but after early 1944, he became supportive of [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s [[Yugoslav Partisans]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

After the Yugoslav Prime Minister [[Ivan Šubašić]] [[Treaty of Vis|recognized the partisan movement]] in June 1944, Furlan replaced [[Alojzij Kuhar]] as the official Slovene speaker of the Yugoslav [[government in exile]] for the [[BBC World Service|Radio London]]. In summer 1944, he had several speeches directed to the members of the collaborationist [[Slovene Home Guard]], urging them to join forces with the partisan forces. One of his speeches, titled ''A Clear Word from London'' was printed on leaflets which were dropped by Allied airplanes over Slovenia. In Autumn 1944, Furlan replaced [[Izidor Cankar]] as Minister for Culture and Telecommunication in the Provisional Government. In early 1945, he went to the liberated territories in southern Slovenia together with [[Franc Snoj]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

==Under the Communist regime==
After the end of World War II, he became the dean of the Faculty of Law of the University of Ljubljana. He tried to maintain a critical attitude towards the [[Communist regime]]; among other things, he secretly translated [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]''.<ref>[http://www.dlib.si/stream/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-VEU77NH8/c725e18f-69aa-4680-950c-fdd6fd553230/PDF "Razprava pred Okrožnim sodiščem v Ljubljani proti vohunski skupini: Nagode, Snoj, Furlan." 1947.

In June 1947, he was arrested and tried at the so-called [[Nagode Trial]], together with 31 other [[liberal democratic]] and [[left-wing]] Slovene intellectuals, such as [[Črtomir Nagode]], [[Ljubo Sirc]], [[Angela Vode]] and Franc Snoj. Furlan was accused of having been member of a [[Masonic lodge]] in the 1930s, of having maintained contacts with the British intelligence since the late 1930s; the main accusation regarded his translation of Orwell's ''Animal Farm'' and his friendly relations with the American Red Cross official Jack Hoptner.<ref>Marta Verginella, ''Il confine degli altri: la questione giuliana e la memoria slovena'' (Rome: Donzelli Editore, 2008), p. 123</ref>

In August 1947, he was sentenced to death.<ref>[http://www.dlib.si/stream/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-MS9GJFP7/cde18fca-3754-4b9d-a28b-20a6fa40badf/PDF "Komentarji. Zbira in presoja urednik." 1947.

In 1952, he moved to the small [[Upper Carniola]]n town of [[Radovljica]] to escape the daily intimidations to which he was subjected in the Slovenian capital.<ref>Marta Verginella, ''Il confine degli altri: la questione giuliana e la memoria slovena'' (Rome: Donzelli Editore, 2008), 123</ref> In November 1953, he was reportedly attacked by agents of the [[UDBA|Yugoslav secret police]], in which he suffered severe injuries.<ref>Marta Verginella, ''Il confine degli altri: la questione giuliana e la memoria slovena'' (Rome: Donzelli Editore, 2008), pp. 123-124</ref>

He died in Ljubljana<ref name="Brecelj"/> or Radovljica<ref name="Jevnikar"/> at the age of 62 and was interred in the cemetery in the [[Vič]] neighborhood of Ljubljana.<ref name="FaG"/>
