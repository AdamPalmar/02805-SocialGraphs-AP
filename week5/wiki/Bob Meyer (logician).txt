'''Robert Kenneth Meyer''' (27 May 1932 â€“ 6 May 2009) was a logician and Professor Emeritus at the [[Australian National University]].

First trained to be a minister at the Union Congregational Church by the [[Princeton Theological Seminary]] in 1956, he completed his graduate studies in [[philosophy]] and [[logic]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. He moved to Australia and joined the [[Australian National University]] in 1974.<ref>[http://users.rsise.anu.edu.au/~rkm/ Home page of Bob Meyer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515214454/http://users.rsise.anu.edu.au/~rkm/ |date=15 May 2008 }}</ref> He worked in [[relevant logic]], particularly on its semantics.{{clarify|date=May 2009}}

He was the Maximum Leader for the [[Logicians Liberation League]], and drafted its manifesto.<ref>[http://users.rsise.anu.edu.au/~rkm/manifesto.html Logicians Liberation League Manifesto] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611111047/http://users.rsise.anu.edu.au/~rkm/manifesto.html |date=11 June 2008}}</ref>

Despite his accomplishments in the areas of philosophy and logic, he fell short in the understanding of the passage of time. On one of his journeys from Philadelphia Pennsylvania to Washington DC, he estimated that the 150 mile drive would take him "Three or four or five hours". On one occasion he lost his passport in the USA one hour prior to his flight to Australia and estimated he had enough time to get a new one "after a shower and a quick stop at the Barnes and Noble".

==Death==
Meyer died of [[lung cancer]] on 6 May 2009, aged 76, in [[Canberra, Australia]].
