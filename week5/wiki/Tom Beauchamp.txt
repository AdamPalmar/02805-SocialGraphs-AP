Beauchamp is the author or co-author of several books on ethics, and on the philosophy of [[David Hume]], including ''[[Hume and the Problem of Causation]]'' (1981, with [[Alexander Rosenberg]]), ''Principles of Biomedical Ethics'' (1985, with [[James Childress|James F. Childress]]), and ''The Human Use of Animals'' (1998, with F. Barbara Orlans ''et al''). He is the co-editor with R.G. Frey of ''The Oxford Handbook of Animal Ethics'' (2011). He is also the co-editor of the complete works of Hume, ''The Critical Edition of the Works of David Hume'' (1999), published by Oxford University Press.<ref name=bio/>

==Education==
He earned his BA from [[Southern Methodist University]] in 1963, a BD from [[Yale Divinity School]], and PhD in philosophy from [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1970. He is a fellow of the [[Hastings Center]].<ref name=bio/>

==Career==
Beauchamp worked on the staff of the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research, where he co-wrote the [[Belmont Report]] in 1978. He later joined with James Childress to write ''Principles of Biomedical Ethics'' (1985), the first major American bioethics textbook.  Beauchamp is also an expert on the philosophy of David Hume. He is the coeditor of the complete works of Hume published by Oxford University Press, and together with Alexander Rosenberg is the author of ''Hume and the Problem of Causation'' (1981), in which Hume's regularity theory of [[Causality|causation]] is defended, along with a nonskeptical interpretation of Hume's arguments against induction.

He has also written extensively about [[animal rights]], and has defended a theory of animal rights which would significantly alter, though would not end, the ways in which non-human animals are currently used.<ref>[http://www.phil.ucalgary.ca/node/676 "Tom Beauchamp - "Rights Theory and Animal Rights"], Department of Philosophy, University of Calgary, accessed 5 June 2012.</ref>
