Kvanvig]] regarded Schellenberg's move to Rutgers as buttressing Rutgers' reputation as having one of the pre-eminent epistemology departments in the world.<ref name=tar/><ref name=certaindoubts>{{cite web|last=Kvanvig|first=Jonathan|title=Adding to Rutgers Strength in Epistemology|url=http://certaindoubts.com/?p=1557|publisher=Certain Doubts|accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref>

==Research areas==
Schellenberg's work has centered around developing a comprehensive account of the epistemological and phenomenological role of perception.<ref name=apacsw/> Her view shows how the epistemic force of experience is grounded in employing perceptual capacities that we possess by virtue of being perceivers<ref name=apacsw/>  Schellenberg has also developed an account of the nature of perceptual content that suggests a new way to understand singular modes of presentation, arguing that perceptual experience is at root both relational and representational.<ref name=apacsw/>  In addition to her main areas of interest, Schellenberg has also written papers on topics such as inferential semantics, the philosophy of [[Gottlob Frege]], and imagination.<ref name=apacsw/><ref name=3am/>  Much of Schellenberg's work to-date has focused on reconcilling apparently contradictory viewpoints on topics in the [[philosophy of mind]].<ref name=tar/>

==Publications==
Schellenberg has published a number of peer-reviewed papers in journals such as [[The Journal of Philosophy]], [[Mind]], [[Noûs]], and [[Philosophy and Phenomenological Research]].<ref name=cv/> She has also contributed five book chapters, including chapters about perceptual experience, externalism and hallucination, and [[Wilfrid Sellars|Sellarsian perspectives]] on perception.<ref name=cv/>
