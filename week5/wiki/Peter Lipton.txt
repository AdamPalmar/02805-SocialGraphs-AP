'''Peter Lipton''' (October 9, 1954 &ndash; November 25, 2007) was the [[Hans Rausing]] [[Professor]] and Head of the Department of [[History and Philosophy of Science]] at [[Cambridge University]], and a fellow of [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]], until his unexpected death in November 2007. According to his obituary on the Cambridge web site, he was "recognized as one of the leading [[philosophy of science|philosophers of science]] and [[epistemology|epistemologists]] in the world."

==Career==
Lipton was an undergraduate at [[Wesleyan University]] and a graduate student at [[Oxford University]]. Before coming to Cambridge, he taught at [[Clark University]] and [[Williams College]]. He was a member of the [[Nuffield Council]] on [[Bioethics]] and chaired the working party that produced ''Pharmacogenetics: Ethical Issues''. He was also on the [[AskPhilosophers]] panel. In 2004, Lipton had the honour of being the [[Medawar Prize Lecturer]] of the [[Royal Society]].

Lipton's research interests focused on the philosophy of science, including topics such as [[explanation]], [[inference]], [[Test method|testing]], [[theory change]], [[Physical law|laws of nature]], and [[scientific realism]]. Lipton's research in philosophy of science led him to do work in other related areas of philosophy; in [[epistemology]], Lipton also investigated the philosophy of [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] and [[Testimony, philosophical problems of|testimony]]. Likewise in [[philosophy of mind]] Lipton researched notions of [[mental content]] and the [[mind-body problem]].

He was a member of the [[Nuffield Council on Bioethics]] (2003â€“2007).

==Personal life==
Lipton lived with his wife Diana and two sons Jonah and Jacob. He was a self-confessed "religious atheist"; he held that he could follow the customs and culture of a Jewish lifestyle, and use the teachings of [[Judaism]] to help him tackle moral problems in life, without simultaneously believing in the [[metaphysics]] of such a religion (such as the existence of [[God]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216140743/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2006/02/03/DI2006020301423.html |title=Post Magazine: Darwin v. God |website=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2017-06-30}}</ref>

On 25 November 2007, Lipton suffered a fatal [[heart attack]] after playing a game of [[Squash (sport)|squash]].  He was succeeded in his capacity as Head of Department of History and Philosophy of Science at the [[University of Cambridge]] by Professor [[John Forrester (historian of philosophy and science)|John Forrester]].
