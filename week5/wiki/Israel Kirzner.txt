'''Israel Meir Kirzner''' (also '''Yisroel Mayer Kirzner''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɜr|z|n|ər}}; born February 13, 1930) is an [[American Jews|American]] economist closely identified with the [[Austrian School]].<ref name="vMI Interview">{{cite web|title=Interview|url=https://www.mises.org/journals/aen/aen17_1_1.asp|work=Austrian Economics Newsletter|publisher=Mises Institute|accessdate=23 June 2013}}</ref>

==Early life==
{{Libertarianism sidebar}}
The son of a well-known [[rabbi]] and [[Talmudist]], Kirzner was born in [[London]] and came to the United States via [[South Africa]].

==Education==
After studying with the [[University of Cape Town]], South Africa in 1947–48 and with the [[University of London External Programme]] in 1950–51, Kirzner received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] ''[[summa cum laude]]'' from [[Brooklyn College]] in 1954, an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] in 1955 and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in 1957 from [[New York University]], where he studied under [[Ludwig von Mises]].

==Economics==
[[File:Israel.kirzner.lecture.for.fee.july.28.2006.jpg|right|thumb|Lecture for the [[Foundation for Economic Education]] on July 28, 2006]]
Kirzner is [[emeritus]] professor of economics at New York University and a leading authority on [[Ludwig von Mises]]'s thinking and [[methodology]] in [[economics]]. Kirzner's research on entrepreneurship economics is also widely recognized.<ref>http://swopec.hhs.se/iuiwop/abs/iuiwop0678.htm</ref> His book, ''Competition and Entrepreneurship'' criticizes neoclassical theory for its preoccupation with the model of '''perfect competition''', which neglects the important role of the entrepreneur in economic life. Kirzner's work integrating entrepreneurial action into neoclassical economics has been more widely accepted than nearly any other Austrian idea of the late twentieth century.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Kirzner's major work is in the economics of knowledge and [[entrepreneurship]] and the [[ethics]] of [[markets]]. Kirzner has said that he agrees with Roger Garrison's statement that Kirzner's work takes the middle ground, as opposed to the recent, more extreme position of some Austrian School economists who deny the relevance of market equilibrium.<ref name="vMI Interview"/>
In 2006, Kirzner received the [[Global Award for Entrepreneurship Research]]<ref>http://www.e-award.org/wfiles/The%20Global%20Award%20for%20Entrepreneurhsip.pdf</ref> " for developing the economic theory emphasizing the importance of the entrepreneur for economic growth and the functioning of the capitalist process.".<ref>http://www.e-award.org/web/2006_Israel_M_Kirzner.aspx</ref> [[Universidad Francisco Marroquín]] granted him an Honorary Doctorate Degree for his contributions to economic theory. Honorary Doctoral Degrees at Universidad Francisco Marroquín UFM also named its Kirzner Entrepreneurship Center in his honor.<ref>[http://fce.ufm.edu/cms/es/descripcion-KEC Kirzner Entrepreneurship Center ]</ref><ref>[https://www.ufm.edu/cms/es/honorary-doctoral-degrees Honorary Doctoral Degrees at Universidad Francisco Marroquín ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501185429/https://www.ufm.edu/cms/es/honorary-doctoral-degrees |date=2011-05-01 }}</ref>
