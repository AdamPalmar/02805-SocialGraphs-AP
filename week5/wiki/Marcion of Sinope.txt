'''Marcion of Sinope''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɑr|ʃ|ə|n|,_|-|ʃ|i|ən|,_|-|s|i|ən}}; [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: Μαρκίων<ref>''[[First Apology of Justin Martyr]]'', [http://khazarzar.skeptik.net/books/justinus/apolog1g.htm XXVI.5]</ref><ref>Genitive: Μαρκίωνος.</ref> Σινώπης; c. 85 &ndash; c. 160) was an important figure <!-- I would suggest "figure" would be more precise than "leader." Since he was considered a heretic, calling him a leader may be disputed, but "figure" would be beyond dispute.  -->in [[early Christianity]]. His [[Marcionism|theology]] rejected the [[deity]] described in the [[Hebrew Bible|Hebrew Scriptures]] and in distinction affirmed the Father of [[Christ]] as the true [[God]]. The [[Church Fathers]] denounced Marcion, and he was excommunicated from the [[Proto-orthodox Christianity|proto-orthodox Church]]. He published his own list of [[New Testament]] books,<ref>Bruce 1988, p. 134</ref> editing some (the Gospel of Luke) and rejecting other books of the New Testament, making him a catalyst in speeding up the process of [[Development of the New Testament canon#Marcion of Sinope|development of the New Testament canon]] by forcing the early Church to respond to his claims.

==Life==
[[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]] records in his ''[[Panarion]]'' that Marcion was born the son of a bishop in [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]]. His near-contemporaries [[Rhodo]] and [[Tertullian]] described him as a "mariner" and a "ship-master," respectively. Marcion made a donation of 200,000 [[Sestertius|sesterces]] to the Church in Rome.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Harnack|first1=Adolf|title=Marcion: The Gospel of the Alien God|publisher=Baker|location=Grand Rapids|isbn=978-1-55635-703-9|page=17}}</ref> Conflicts with the Church of Rome arose and he was eventually [[excommunication|excommunicated]], his donation being returned to him.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Harnack|first1=Adolf|title=Marcion: The Gospel of the Alien God|publisher=Baker|location=Grand Rapids|isbn=978-1-55635-703-9|page=18}}</ref>  After his excommunication, he returned to [[History of Anatolia#Christianity in Anatolia during Roman times|Asia Minor]], where he continued to lead his many church congregations and teach the [[Gospel of Marcion]].

According to anti-Marcionite sources, Marcion's teacher was the Simonian [[Cerdo (gnostic)|Cerdo]]. [[Irenaeus]] writes that "a certain Cerdo, originating from the [[Simonians]], came to Rome under [[Pope Hyginus|Hyginus]] ... and taught that the one who was proclaimed as God by the Law and the Prophets is not the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ" (''[[Against Heresies]]'', 1, 27, 1).

In 394, [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]] claimed that after beginnings as an [[ascetic]], Marcion seduced a [[virgin]] and was accordingly excommunicated by his father, prompting him to leave his home town.<ref>''[[Refutation of All Heresies]]'', XLII, ii.</ref> This account has been doubted by many scholars, who consider it "malicious gossip". More recently, [[Bart D. Ehrman]] suggests that this "seduction of a virgin" was a metaphor for his corruption of the Christian Church, with the Church portrayed as the undefiled virgin.<ref>[[Bart D. Ehrman]], ''Lost Christianities''</ref> Similarly doubtful is Tertullian's claim in ''The Prescription Against Heretics'' (written ca. 200) that Marcion professed repentance, and agreed to the conditions granted to him—that he should receive reconciliation if he restored to the Church those whom he had led astray—but that he was prevented from doing so by his death.<ref>[http://www.tertullian.org/anf/anf03/anf03-24.htm#P3125_1133921 ''The Prescription Against Heretics''] 30:3. Tertullian.org.</ref>

==Teachings==
{{Main|Marcionism}}
Study of the [[Tanakh|Hebrew scriptures]], along with received writings circulating in the nascent Church, led Marcion to conclude that many of the [[Ministry of Jesus|teachings of Jesus]] were incompatible with the actions of [[Yahweh]], the belligerent god of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. Marcion responded by developing a [[ditheism|ditheistic]] system of belief around the year 144.<ref>115 years and 6 months from the [[Crucifixion]], according to [[Tertullian]]'s reckoning in ''Adversus Marcionem'', xv.</ref> This notion of two gods—a higher transcendent one and a lower world creator and ruler—allowed Marcion to reconcile his perceived contradictions between Christian [[Old Covenant]] theology and the [[Good news (Christianity)|Gospel]] message proclaimed by the [[New Testament]].

In contrast to other leaders of the nascent Christian Church, however, Marcion declared that Christianity was in complete discontinuity with [[Judaism]] and entirely opposed to the [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible). Marcion did not claim that the Jewish scriptures were false. Instead, he asserted that they were to be read in an absolutely literal manner, thereby developing an understanding that Yahweh was not the same god spoken of by Jesus. For example, Marcion argued that the [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] account of Yahweh walking through the [[Garden of Eden]] asking where Adam was, had proved Yahweh inhabited a physical body and was without universal knowledge ([[omniscience]]), attributes wholly incompatible with the Heavenly Father professed by Jesus.

According to Marcion, the god of the [[Old Testament]], whom he called the [[Demiurge]], the [[Creator deity|creator]] of the material [[universe]], is a jealous [[National god|tribal deity]] of the [[Jews]], whose [[Torah|law]] represents [[legalism (theology)|legalistic]] [[eye for an eye|reciprocal justice]] and who punishes mankind for its sins through suffering and death. In contrast, the god that Jesus professed is an altogether different being, a universal god of compassion and love who looks upon humanity with benevolence and mercy. Marcion also produced his ''Antitheses,'' contrasting the Demiurge of the Old Testament with the Heavenly Father of the New Testament.

Marcion held Jesus to be the son of the Heavenly Father but understood the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]] in a [[Docetism|docetic]] manner, i.e. that Jesus' body was only an imitation of a material body, and consequently denied Jesus' physical and bodily birth, death, and resurrection.

Marcion was the first to introduce an early Christian [[Development of the New Testament canon#Marcion of Sinope|canon]]. His canon consisted of only eleven books, grouped into two sections: the ''[[Gospel of Marcion|Evangelikon]]'', based on Luke with parts removed that did not agree with his views,<ref name="Wilkinson2015">{{cite book|author=Robert J. Wilkinson|title=Tetragrammaton: Western Christians and the Hebrew Name of God: From the Beginnings to the Seventeenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1xyoBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA120|date=5 February 2015|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-28817-1|pages=120–}}</ref> and the ''[[Pauline epistles|Apostolikon]]'', a selection of ten epistles of Paul the Apostle (also altered to fit his views),<ref name="Wilkinson2015"/> whom Marcion considered the correct interpreter and transmitter of Jesus' teachings. The gospel used by Marcion does not contain elements relating to Jesus' birth and childhood, although it does contain some elements of Judaism, and material challenging Marcion's ditheism.

==Gnosticism==
Marcion is sometimes described as a [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] philosopher. In some essential respects, Marcion proposed ideas which would have aligned well with Gnostic thought. Like the Gnostics, he argued that Jesus was essentially a divine spirit appearing to human beings in the shape of a human form, and not someone in a true physical body.<ref name="Harnack">Adolph Harnack, ''Marcion: The Gospel of the Alien God'' (1924).{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref>

However, Marcionism conceptualizes God in a way which cannot be reconciled with broader Gnostic thought. For Gnostics, some human beings are born with a small piece of God's soul lodged within his/her spirit (akin to the notion of a [[Divine Spark]]).<ref name="Harnack"/> God is thus intimately connected to and part of his creation. Salvation lies in turning away from the physical world (which Gnostics regard as an illusion) and embracing the godlike qualities within yourself. Marcion, by contrast, held that the Heavenly Father (the father of Jesus Christ) was an utterly alien god; he had no part in making the world, nor any connection with it.<ref name="Harnack"/>

==Legacy==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2017}}
In hindsight, Marcion is seen as one of the first [[Heresiarch|heresiarchs]] for his deviations from what would become the orthodox positions of the main authorities in the Catholic Church. The suppression of the Marcionist form of Christianity is thus viewed<ref>Bruce 1988, p. 151</ref> as a catalyst for the [[development of the New Testament canon]], the establishment of a centralized [[Canon law|church law]], and the structuring of the Church.

The church centered on the Marcionist interpretation of the Christian gospel expanded greatly within Marcion's lifetime, became a rival to the [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] Christian Church and retained its following for several centuries. It survived Christian controversy, and imperial disapproval, for several centuries more.<ref>Evans 1972 p. ix</ref>

Marcion proposed and delineated a [[:wikt:canon|canon]] (a list of officially sanctioned religious works). This prompted the orthodox part of the Church to form a separate official canon of books that had been recognized as divinely inspired and authoritative. Christians began to divide texts into those that aligned with the "measuring stick" (Greek ''kanōn'' literally means "measuring stick") as being apostolic, authoritative, Christian writings (the works of the Old and New Testaments as we know them today), those that were rejected as heretical or pseudonymous, and those that were accepted but not seen as canon or read in public gatherings (the [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]], e.g., [[The Shepherd of Hermas]]). Therefore, Marcion played a role in finalizing the structure and contents of the collection of works now called the [[New Testament]].
