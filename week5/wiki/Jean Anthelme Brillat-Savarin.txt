'''Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒɑ̃ ɑ̃tɛlm bʁija savaʁɛ̃}}; 1 April 1755, [[Belley]], [[Ain]] – 2 February 1826, [[Paris]]) was a [[French people|French]] lawyer and politician, and gained fame as an [[Epicureanism|epicure]] and [[Gastronomy|gastronome]]: "[[Alexandre Balthazar Laurent Grimod de La Reynière|Grimod]] and Brillat-Savarin. Between them, two writers effectively founded the whole genre of the gastronomic essay."<ref>Stephen Mennell, ''All manners of food: eating and taste in England and France from the Middle Ages to the Present'', 2nd ed. 1996, p. 267.</ref>

==Biography==
Brillat-Savarin was born in the town of [[Belley]], [[Ain]], where the [[Rhône]] River then separated France from [[Savoy]], to a family of lawyers. He studied [[law]], [[chemistry]] and [[medicine]] in [[Dijon]] in his early years and later practiced law in his hometown.  In 1789, at the opening of the [[French Revolution]], he was sent as a deputy to the [[French States-General|Estates-General]] that soon became the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]], where he acquired some limited fame, particularly for a public speech in defense of [[capital punishment]].  His father Marc Anthelme adopted his second surname in 1733 upon the death of an aunt named Savarin who left him her entire fortune on the condition that he adopt her name.

He returned to Belley and was for a year the elected mayor. At a later stage of the Revolution there was a bounty on his head, and he sought shelter in [[Switzerland]] at some relatives' place in [[Moudon]] and then in the ''hôtel du Lion d'Argent'' in [[Lausanne]].  He later moved to [[Holland]], and then to the new-born [[United States]], where he stayed for three years in Boston, New York, Philadelphia and Hartford, living on the proceeds of giving [[French language|French]] and [[violin]] lessons. For a time he was first violin in the [[Park Theatre (Manhattan)|Park Theater]] in [[New York City|New York]].

He returned to France under the [[French Directory|Directory]] in 1797 and acquired the magistrate post he would hold for the remainder of his life, as a judge of the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]]. 

===Writings===
He published several works on law and political economy. He also wrote an erotic short story, ''Voyage à Arras''.<ref>[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k399963/f1.image ''Voyage à Arras''], Dynamo, Pierre Aelberts, Liège 1950.</ref> He remained a bachelor, but not a stranger to love, which he counted the sixth sense: his inscription of the ''Physiologie'' to his beautiful cousin [[Juliette Récamier]] reads
<blockquote>"Madam, receive kindly and read indulgently the work of an old man. It is a tribute of a friendship which dates from your childhood, and, perhaps, the homage of a more tender feeling...How can I tell? At my age a man no longer dares interrogate his heart."<ref>Quoted by Anne Drayton, Introduction to ''[[The Physiology of Taste]]'', 1994, p. 11.</ref> </blockquote>

His famous work, ''Physiologie du goût'' (''The Physiology of Taste''), was published in December 1825, two months before his death.  The full title is
''Physiologie du Goût, ou Méditations de Gastronomie Transcendante; ouvrage théorique, historique et à l'ordre du jour, dédié aux Gastronomes parisiens, par un Professeur, membre de plusieurs sociétés littéraires et savantes''.<ref>"''The physiology of taste, or, Meditations of transcendent gastronomy; a theoretical, historical and topical work, dedicated to the gastronomes of Paris by a professor, member of several literary and scholarly societies''"</ref> The book has not been out of print since it first appeared, shortly before Brillat-Savarin's death.<ref>Mennell, 1996, p. 268.</ref>  Its most notable English translation was done by food writer and critic [[M. F. K. Fisher]], who remarked "I hold myself blessed among translators."  Her translation was first published in 1949.

The body of his work, though often wordy or excessively – and sometimes dubiously – [[Aphorism|aphoristic]] and [[axiom]]atic, has remained extremely important and has repeatedly been re-analyzed through the years since his death. In a series of meditations that owe something to [[Montaigne]]'s Essays, and have the discursive rhythm of an age of leisured reading and a confident pursuit of educated pleasures, Brillat-Savarin discourses on the pleasures of the table, which he considers a science. His French models were the stylists of the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'': [[Voltaire]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[François Fénelon|Fénelon]], [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]], [[Pierre-Suzanne-Augustin Cochin|Cochin]] and [[Henri-Cardin-Jean-Baptiste d'Aguesseau|d'Aguesseau]]. 

Aside from [[Latin]], he knew five modern languages well, and when the occasion suited, wasn't shy of parading them: he never hesitated to borrow a word, like the English ''sip'' when French seemed to him to fail, until he rediscovered the then-obsolete verb ''siroter''.

The [[philosophy]] of [[Epicurus]] lies at the back of every page; the simplest meal satisfied Brillat-Savarin, as long as it was executed with artistry:
:''Those persons who suffer from indigestion, or who become drunk, are utterly ignorant of the true principles of eating and drinking.''

==Influence==
[[Brillat-Savarin cheese]], the [[Savarin mould]], a ring mold with a rounded contour, and ''[[Savarin cake|Gâteau Savarin]]'' are named in his honor.

His reputation was revitalized among modern [[Gastronomy|gastronomes]] in many parts of the world, by his influence over [[Takeshi Kaga|Chairman Kaga]] of the TV series "[[Iron Chef]]" which introduced to millions to his famous aphorism: "Tell me what you eat, and I will tell you what you are."

Brillat-Savarin is often considered as the father of [[low-carbohydrate diet]]. He considered sugar and white flour to be the cause of [[obesity]] and he suggested instead protein-rich ingredients. <blockquote>
Sure enough, carnivorous animals never grow fat (consider wolves, jackals, birds of prey, crows, etc.). Herbivorous animals do not grow fat easily, at least until age has reduced them to a state of inactivity; but they fatten very quickly as soon as they begin to be fed on potatoes, grain, or any kind of flour. ... The second of the chief causes of obesity is the floury and starchy substances which man makes the prime ingredients of his daily nourishment.  As we have said already, all animals that live on farinaceous food grow fat willy-nilly; and man is no exception to the universal law.

[[Eneas Sweetland Dallas]] wrote ''Kettner's Book of the Table, a Manual of Cookery'', 1877, a treatise on [[gastronomy]] based on the work of Brillat-Savarin. Dallas published his book under the pseudonym of A. Kettner.

==Quotes==
*'Whoever receives friends and does not participate in the preparation of their meal does not deserve to have friends.'
*He compared after-taste, the perfume or fragrance of food, to musical [[harmonics]] (Meditation ii): "but for the odour which is felt in the back of the mouth, the sensation of taste would be but obtuse and imperfect".
*An avid [[cheese]] lover, Brillat-Savarin remarked: "A dessert without cheese is like a beautiful woman with only one eye."
*"The discovery of a new dish confers more happiness on humanity than the discovery of a new star."

*"To receive guests is to take charge of their happiness during the entire time they are under your roof."
*"Cooking is one of the oldest arts and one that has rendered us the most important service in civic life."
*"The pleasure of the table belongs to all ages, to all conditions, to all countries, and to all areas; it mingles with all other pleasures, and remains at last to console us for their departure."<ref>Jean Brillat-Savarin.
