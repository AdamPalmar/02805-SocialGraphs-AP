'''Margaret Mead''' (December 16, 1901&nbsp;– November 15, 1978) was an American [[Cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologist]] who featured frequently as an author and speaker in the mass media during the 1960s and 1970s.<ref name="libraryofcongress"/> She earned her bachelor's degree at [[Barnard College]] in [[New York City]] and her M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from [[Columbia University]].

Mead was a respected and often controversial academic who popularized the insights of anthropology in modern American and [[Western culture]].<ref name=SciAmeri>{{cite web |last=Horgan |first=John |title=Margaret Mead’s bashers owe her an apology |url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/2010/10/25/margaret-meads-bashers-owe-her-an-apology/ |publisher=Scientific America}}</ref> Her reports detailing the attitudes towards sex in South Pacific and Southeast Asian traditional cultures influenced the 1960s [[sexual revolution]]. She was a proponent of broadening sexual mores within a context of traditional Western religious life.

==Birth, early family life, and education==
Margaret Mead, the first of five children, was born in [[Philadelphia]], but raised in nearby [[Doylestown, Pennsylvania]]. Her father, Edward Sherwood Mead, was a professor of finance at the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]],  and her mother, Emily (née Fogg) Mead,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/mead/mead-shaping.html |title=Shaping Forces – Margaret Mead: Human Nature and the Power of Culture (Library of Congress Exhibition) |publisher=Loc.gov |accessdate=2010-09-29}}</ref> was a sociologist who studied Italian immigrants.<ref name="unesco bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.ibe.unesco.org/publications/ThinkersPdf/meade.pdf |title="Margaret Mead" by Wilton S.

This was a traumatic event for Mead, who had named the girl, and thoughts of her lost sister permeated her daydreams for many years.<ref name=Howard /> Her family moved frequently, so her early education was directed by her Grandmother until, at age 11, she was enrolled by her family at [[Buckingham Friends School]] in Lahaska, Pennsylvania.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stella|first1=Nicole and Jenifer|title=New Hope, Lahaska, and Buckingham (PA) (Images of America)|date=July 18, 2005|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=0738537969|page=46|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uyGs_qfSMQwC&lpg=PA42&vq=Buckingham%20Friends%20School&pg=PA46#v=onepage&q=Buckingham%20Friends%20School&f=false}}</ref> Her family owned the [[Longland (Holicong, Pennsylvania)|Longland]] farm from 1912 to 1926.<ref name="arch">{{cite web| url = https://www.dot7.state.pa.us/ce/SelectWelcome.asp| title = National Historic Landmarks & National Register of Historic Places in Pennsylvania| publisher = CRGIS: Cultural Resources Geographic Information System| format = Searchable database}} ''Note:'' This includes {{cite web| url = https://www.dot7.state.pa.us/ce_imagery/phmc_scans/H099089_01H.pdf| title = National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Longland| accessdate = 2012-09-30| author =Jeffrey L.

She studied with professor [[Franz Boas]] and Dr. [[Ruth Benedict]] at [[Columbia University]] before earning her master's degree in 1924.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/women/article-9051668 |title=Encyclopædia Britannica's Guide to Women's History |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=2010-09-29}}</ref> Mead set out in 1925 to do fieldwork in [[Samoa]].<ref>Mead 1977</ref>  In 1926, she joined the [[American Museum of Natural History]], [[New York City]], as assistant curator.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webster.edu/~woolflm/margaretmead.html |title=Margaret Mead |publisher=Webster.edu |date=1901-12-18 |accessdate=2010-09-29}}</ref>  She received her Ph.D. from [[Columbia University]] in 1929.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/mmead.htm |title=Margaret Mead |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210175324/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/mmead.htm |archivedate=10 February 2015 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref>

==Personal life==
Before departing for Samoa, Mead had a short affair with the linguist [[Edward Sapir]], a close friend of  her instructor [[Ruth Benedict]]. But Sapir's conservative ideas about marriage and the [[gender role|woman's role]] were anathema to Mead, and as Mead left to do field work in [[Samoa]] the two separated permanently. Mead received news of Sapir's remarriage while living in Samoa, where, on a beach, she later burned their correspondence.<ref>{{cite book| last = Darnell| first = Regna| title = Edward Sapir: linguist, anthropologist, humanist| publisher = University of California Press| year = 1989| location = Berkeley| page = 187| isbn = 978-0-520-06678-6 }}</ref>

Mead was married three times. Her first husband (1923–28) was American [[Luther Cressman]], a theology student at the time who eventually became an anthropologist. Mead dismissively characterized their union as "my student marriage" in ''Blackberry Winter'', a [[sobriquet]] with which Cressman took vigorous issue. Her second husband (1928–1935) was New Zealander [[Reo Fortune]], a [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] graduate and fellow anthropologist. Mead's third and longest-lasting marriage (1936–50) was to the British anthropologist [[Gregory Bateson]], with whom she had a daughter, [[Mary Catherine Bateson]], who would also become an anthropologist.

Mead's pediatrician was [[Benjamin Spock]],<ref name="libraryofcongress"/> whose subsequent writings on child rearing incorporated some of Mead's own practices and beliefs acquired from her ethnological field observations which she shared with him; in particular, [[breastfeeding]] on the baby's demand rather than a schedule.<ref>Moore 2004: 105.</ref>  She readily acknowledged that Gregory Bateson was the husband she loved the most. She was devastated when he left her, and she remained his loving friend ever after, keeping his photograph by her bedside wherever she traveled, including beside her hospital deathbed.<ref name=Howard/>{{rp|428}}
[[File:Margaret Mead (1972).jpg|thumb|Margaret Mead (1972)]]
Mead also had an exceptionally close relationship with Ruth Benedict, one of her instructors. In her memoir about her parents, ''With a Daughter's Eye'', Mary Catherine Bateson implies that the relationship between Benedict and Mead was partly sexual.<ref name=MCBateson>Bateson 1984; Lapsley 1999.</ref>{{rp|117–118}} Mead never openly identified herself as lesbian or bisexual. In her writings she proposed that it is to be expected that an individual's [[sexual orientation]] may evolve throughout life.<ref name=MCBateson/>

She spent her last years in a close personal and professional collaboration with anthropologist [[Rhoda Metraux]], with whom she lived from 1955 until her death in 1978. Letters between the two published in 2006 with the permission of Mead's daughter<ref>Caffey and Francis 2006.</ref> clearly express a romantic relationship.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Both of Mead's surviving sisters were married to well-known men. Elizabeth Mead (1909–1983), an artist and teacher, married cartoonist [[William Steig]], and Priscilla Mead (1911–1959) married author [[Leo Rosten]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QegaBoxPOrsC&pg=PA88&lpg=PA88&dq=leo+rosten+william+steig&source=bl&ots=EYD118S9o2&sig=raYzr5XbBa33-47I8--TLqt6uZ8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=TtY1VM7KNpKcyASCkoDoDQ&ved=0CD4Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=leo%20rosten%20william%20steig&f=false|isbn=9780307773401|title=Intertwined Lives: Margaret Mead, Ruth Benedict, and Their Circle|last=Banner|first=Lois W.|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|year=2010}}</ref> Mead also had a brother, Richard, who became a professor.

==Career and later life==
[[File:Margaret Mead (1901-1978) (2).jpg|thumb|left|Mead at New York Academy of Sciences, 1968]]
During [[World War II]], Mead served as executive secretary of the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]]'s Committee on Food Habits. She served as curator of [[ethnology]] at the American Museum of Natural History from 1946 to 1969. She was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1948.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter M|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterM.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=16 April 2011}}</ref> She taught at [[The New School]] and Columbia University, where she was an adjunct professor from 1954 to 1978 and was a professor of anthropology and chair of the Division of Social Sciences at [[Fordham University]]'s Lincoln Center campus from 1968 to 1970, founding their anthropology department. In 1970, she joined the faculty of the [[University of Rhode Island]] as a Distinguished Professor of Sociology and Anthropology.<ref>p. 94 in: Wheaton, J., and [[Richard Vangermeersch|R.

Following Ruth Benedict's example, Mead focused her research on problems of child rearing, personality, and culture.<ref>''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', Fifth Edition, 1993.</ref> She served as president of the [[American Anthropological Association]] in 1960. In the mid-1960s, Mead joined forces with communications theorist [[Rudolf Modley]], jointly establishing an organization called GYLPHS, inc., whose goal was to create  a universal graphic symbol language to be understood by any members of culture, no matter how primitive.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bresnahan|first=Keith|year=2011|title="An Unused Esperanto": Internationalism and Pictographic Design, 1930-70|journal=Design and Culture|volume=3|issue=1}}</ref> In the 1960s, Mead served as the Vice President of the [[New York Academy of Sciences]].<ref name="NYAS History">{{cite book|last1=Baatz|first1=Simon|title=Knowledge, Culture, and Science in the Metropolis: The New York Academy of Sciences, 1817–1970|publisher=The New York Academy of Sciences|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nyas.1990.584.issue-1/issuetoc|accessdate=12 November 2016}}</ref> She held various positions in the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], notably president in 1975 and chair of the executive committee of the board of directors in 1976.<ref>{{cite web|author=Wendy Kolmar |url=http://www.depts.drew.edu/wmst/corecourses/wmst111/timeline_bios/MMead.htm |title=Margaret Mead |publisher=Depts.drew.edu |accessdate=2010-09-29}}</ref> She was a recognizable figure in academia, usually wearing a distinctive cape and carrying a walking-stick.<ref name="libraryofcongress">{{cite web | url=http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/mead/oneworld-comment.html | title=Margaret Mead As a Cultural Commentator | work=Margaret Mead: Human nature and the power of culture | publisher=[[Library of Congress]] | accessdate=2008-03-08}}</ref>

Mead was featured on two [[album|record albums]] published by [[Folkways Records]]. The first, released in 1959, ''An Interview With Margaret Mead,'' explored the topics of morals and anthropology. In 1971, she was included in a compilation of talks by prominent women, ''But the Women Rose, Vol.2: Voices of Women in American History''.<ref>[http://www.folkways.si.edu/searchresults.aspx?sPhrase=Margaret%20Mead&sType='phrase'/ Mead] at [[Smithsonian Folkways]]</ref>

In later life, Mead was a mentor to many young anthropologists and sociologists, including [[Jean Houston]].<ref name="Howard"/>{{rp|370–71}}

In 1976, Mead was a key participant at [[UN Habitat I]], the first UN forum on human settlements.

Mead died of [[pancreatic cancer]] on November 15, 1978 and is buried at Trinity Episcopal Church Cemetery, [[Buckingham, Pennsylvania]].<ref>Wilson, Scott.

==Work==

===''Coming of Age in Samoa'' (1928)===
{{Main article|Coming of Age in Samoa}}
[[File:Samoan taupou girl 1896.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Samoan girl, c. 1896]]
In the foreword to ''Coming of Age in Samoa'', Mead's advisor, [[Franz Boas]], wrote of its significance:

<blockquote>Courtesy, modesty, good manners, conformity to definite ethical standards are universal, but what constitutes courtesy, modesty, very good manners, and definite ethical standards is not universal.  It is instructive to know that standards differ in the most unexpected ways.<ref>Franz Boas, "Preface" in Margaret Mead, ''Coming of Age in Samoa''</ref></blockquote>

Mead's findings suggested that the community ignores both boys and girls until they are about 15 or 16. Before then, children have no social standing within the community. Mead also found that marriage is regarded as a social and economic arrangement where wealth, rank, and job skills of the husband and wife are taken into consideration.
[[File:Margaret Mead NYWTS.jpg|thumb|left|Mead, ca. 1950.]]

In 1983, five years after Mead had died, New Zealand anthropologist [[Derek Freeman]] published ''Margaret Mead and Samoa: The Making and Unmaking of an Anthropological Myth'', in which he challenged Mead's major findings about sexuality in Samoan society.<ref>{{YouTube|GOCYhmnx6o8|Margaret Mead and Samoa}}.  Documentary about the [[Mead-Freeman controversy#The Mead-Freeman controversy|Mead-Freeman controversy]], including an interview with one of Mead's original informants.</ref> Freeman's book was controversial in its turn: later in 1983 the [[American Anthropological Association]] declared it to be "poorly written, unscientific, irresponsible and misleading."<ref>{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E0DD103CF936A3575BC0A9679C8B63 | work=The New York Times | title=Derek Freeman, Who Challenged Margaret Mead on Samoa, Dies at 84 | first=John | last=Shaw | date=2001-08-05 | accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref>

In 1999, Freeman published another book, ''The Fateful Hoaxing of Margaret Mead: A Historical Analysis of Her Samoan Research'', including previously unavailable material. In his obituary in the New York Times, John Shaw stated that his thesis, though upsetting many, had by the time of his death generally gained widespread acceptance.<ref>John Shaw, [https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/05/world/derek-freeman-who-challenged-margaret-mead-on-samoa-dies-at-84.html 'Derek Freeman, Who Challenged Margaret Mead on Samoa, Dies at 84,'] [[New York Times]] 5 August 2001.</ref> Recent work has nonetheless challenged his critique.<ref>Paul Shankman,[''The Trashing of Margaret Mead: Anatomy of an Anthropological Controversy,''] University of Wisconsin Press, 2009 esp. pp.47-71.</ref> A frequent criticism of Freeman is that he regularly misrepresented Mead's research and views.<ref name="ReferenceA">Shankman, Paul 2009 ''The Trashing of Margaret Mead: Anatomy of an Anthropological Controversy''.  Madison: The University of Wisconsin Press</ref><ref>See Appell 1984, Brady 1991, Feinberg 1988, Leacock 1988, Levy 1984, Marshall 1993, Nardi 1984, Patience and Smith 1986, Paxman 1988, Scheper-Hughes 1984, Shankman 1996, Young and Juan 1985</ref> In a 2009 evaluation of the debate, anthropologist Paul Shankman concluded that:
:"There is now a large body of criticism of Freeman's work from a number of perspectives in which Mead, Samoa, and anthropology appear in a very different light than they do in Freeman's work. Indeed, the immense significance that Freeman gave his critique looks like 'much ado about nothing' to many of his critics."<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

While nurture-oriented anthropologists are more inclined to agree with Mead's conclusions, there are other non-anthropologists who take a nature-oriented approach following Freeman's lead, among them Harvard psychologist [[Steven Pinker]], biologist [[Richard Dawkins]], evolutionary psychologist [[David Buss]], science writer [[Matt Ridley]] and classicist [[Mary Lefkowitz]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unl.edu/rhames/courses/current/readings/Shankman-Trashing%20of%20Margaret%20Mead.pdf |title=The Trashing of Margaret Mead - How Derek Freeman Fooled us all on an Alleged Hoax |publisher= |accessdate=2013-11-02}}</ref> The philosopher [[Peter Singer]] has also criticized Mead in his book ''[[A Darwinian Left]]'', where he states that "Freeman compiles a convincing case that Mead had misunderstood Samoan customs".<ref name="autogenerated33">Singer, Peter, ''A Darwinian Left'', Yale University Press, 1999, p. 33.</ref>

In 1996, Martin Orans examined Mead's notes preserved at the Library of Congress, and credits her for leaving all of her recorded data available to the general public. Orans point out that Freeman's basic criticisms, that Mead was duped by ceremonial virgin Fa'apua'a Fa'amu (who later swore to Freeman that she had played a joke on Mead) were equivocal for several reasons: first, Mead was well aware of the forms and frequency of Samoan joking; second, she provided a careful account of the sexual restrictions on ceremonial virgins that corresponds to Fa'apua'a Fa'auma'a's account to Freeman, and third, that Mead's notes make clear that she had reached her conclusions about Samoan sexuality before meeting Fa'apua'a Fa'amu.   Orans points out that Mead's data support several different conclusions, and that Mead's conclusions hinge on an interpretive, rather than positivist, approach to culture. Orans goes on to point out, concerning Mead's work elsewhere, that her own notes do not support her published conclusive claims.  However, there are still those who claim Mead was hoaxed, including Peter Singer and zoologist [[David Attenborough]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://urplay.se/Produkter/170954-Stora-tankare-Inom-psykologin |title=Big Thinkers Within Psychology.

===''Sex and Temperament in Three Primitive Societies'' (1935)===
Another influential book by Mead was ''Sex and Temperament in Three Primitive Societies''.<ref name="Mead 2003">{{cite book|last=Mead|first=Margaret|title=Sex and Temperament in Three Primitive Societies|year=2003|publisher=Perennial an impr. of HarperCollins Publ.|location=New York|isbn=978-0060934958|edition=1st Perennial}}</ref> This became a major cornerstone of the [[feminist movement]], since it claimed that females are dominant in the Tchambuli (now spelled [[Chambri people|Chambri]]) Lake region of the Sepik basin of [[Papua New Guinea]] (in the western Pacific) without causing any special problems. The lack of male dominance may have been the result of the Australian administration's outlawing of warfare. According to contemporary research, males are dominant throughout [[Melanesia]] (although some believe that female witches have special powers){{citation needed|date=March 2016}}. Others have argued that there is still much cultural variation throughout Melanesia, and especially in the large island of [[New Guinea]]. Moreover, anthropologists often overlook the significance of networks of political influence among females.  The formal male-dominated institutions typical of some areas of high population density were not, for example, present in the same way in Oksapmin, West Sepik Province, a more sparsely populated area. Cultural patterns there were different from, say, Mt. Hagen. They were closer to those described by Mead.

Mead stated that the [[Arapesh people]], also in the Sepik, were [[pacifist]]s, although she noted that they do on occasion engage in warfare. Her observations about the sharing of garden plots among the Arapesh, the [[egalitarian]] emphasis in child rearing, and her documentation of predominantly peaceful relations among relatives are very different from the "big man" displays of dominance that were documented in more stratified New Guinea cultures—e.g. by Andrew Strathern. They are a different cultural pattern.

In brief, her comparative study revealed a full range of contrasting gender roles:

*"Among the Arapesh, both men and women were peaceful in temperament and neither men nor women made war.
*"Among the [[Mundugumor people|Mundugumor]], the opposite was true:  both men and women were warlike in temperament.
*"And the Tchambuli were different from both.  The men 'primped' and spent their time decorating themselves while the women worked and were the practical ones—the opposite of how it seemed in early 20th century America." {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Deborah Gewertz (1981) studied the Chambri (called Tchambuli by Mead) in 1974–1975 and found no evidence of such gender roles. Gewertz states that as far back in history as there is evidence (1850s) Chambri men dominated over the women, controlled their produce and made all important political decisions. In later years there has been a diligent search for societies in which women dominate men, or for signs of such past societies, but none have been found (Bamberger, 1974).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=vE85zkFdURQC&pg=PA263 Bamberger, Joan, ''The Myth of Matriarchy: Why Men Rule in Primitive Society'', in M. Rosaldo & L. Lamphere, ''Women, Culture, and Society'' (Stanford, Calif.: Stanford Univ. Press, 1974)], p.&nbsp;263.</ref>

Despite its feminist roots, Mead's work on women and men was also criticized by [[Betty Friedan]] 
on the basis that it contributes to infantilizing women.<ref name="friedan">{{cite book|last=Friedan|first=Betty|authorlink=Betty Friedan|title=The Feminine Mystique|year=1963|publisher=W.W.Norton|isbn=0393322572|chapter=The Functional Freeze, The Feminine Protest, and Margaret Mead}}</ref>

===Other research areas===
In 1926, there was much debate about [[race and intelligence]]. Mead felt the methodologies involved in the experimental psychology research supporting arguments of racial superiority in intelligence were substantially flawed. In "The Methodology of Racial Testing: Its Significance for Sociology" Mead proposes that there are three problems with testing for racial differences in intelligence. First, there are concerns with the ability to validly equate one’s test score with what Mead refers to as ''racial admixture'' or how much ''Negro or Indian blood'' an individual possesses. She also considers whether this information is relevant when interpreting IQ scores. Mead remarks that a genealogical method could be considered valid if it could be “subjected to extensive verification”. In addition, the experiment would need a steady control group to establish whether racial admixture was actually affecting intelligence scores. Next, Mead argues that it is difficult to measure the effect that social status has on the results of a person’s intelligence test. By this she meant that  environment (i.e., family structure, socioeconomic status, exposure to language) has too much influence on an individual to attribute inferior scores solely to a physical characteristic such as race. Lastly, Mead adds that language barriers sometimes create the biggest problem of all. Similarly, Stephen J. Gould finds three main problems with intelligence testing, in his book ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]'' that relate to Mead's view of the problem of determining whether there are indeed racial differences in intelligence.<ref>Mead, Margaret, "The Methodology of Racial Testing: Its Significance for Sociology" ''American Journal of Sociology'' 31, no. 5 (March 1926): 657–667.</ref><ref>Gould, Stephen J. ''The Mismeasure of Man'', New York City: W. W. Norton & Company, 1981.</ref>

In 1929 Mead and Fortune visited [[Manus Island|Manus]], now the northern-most province of Papua New Guinea, travelling there by boat from [[Rabaul]]. She amply describes her stay there in her autobiography and it is mentioned in her 1984 biography by [[Jane Howard (journalist)|Jane Howard]]. On Manus she studied the Manus people of the south coast village of Peri. "Over the next five decades Mead would come back oftener to Peri than to any other field site of her career.<ref>[[Jane Howard (journalist)|Jane Howard]], ''Margaret Mead: A Life'', New York: Simon and Schuster, p. 117.</ref>

Mead has been credited with persuading the [[American Jewish Committee]] to sponsor a project to study European Jewish villages, ''[[shtetl]]s'', in which a team of researchers would conduct mass interviews with Jewish immigrants living in New York City. The resulting book, widely cited for decades, allegedly created the [[Jewish mother stereotype]], a mother intensely loving but controlling to the point of smothering, and engendering guilt in her children through the suffering she professed to undertake for their sakes.<ref>"[http://www.slate.com/id/2167961/slideshow/2167764/entry/2167761/fs/0/ The Jewish Mother]", ''Slate'', June 13, 2007, p. 3</ref>

Mead worked for the RAND Corporation, a U.S. Air Force military funded private research organization, from 1948 to 1950 to study Russian culture and attitudes toward authority.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=20cZMZV0tI0C&pg=PA321&lpg=PA321&dq=%22margaret+mead%22+%22RAND+corporation%22&source=bl&ots=ZHDV-6QA4X&sig=NKq11dSbryuHBQ7WvhAqYyfOpFg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=PE2LT8q0M-nr0gHY1dSACg&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22margaret%20mead%22%20%22RAND%20corporation%22&f=false |title=Margaret Mead: The Making of an American Icon|author= Nancy Lutkehaus}}</ref>

As an [[Anglican]] Christian, Mead played a considerable part in the drafting of the 1979 American [[Episcopal Church in the USA|Episcopal]] [[Book of Common Prayer]].<ref name=Howard>Howard 1984.</ref>{{rp|347–348}}

==Controversy==
After her death Mead's Samoan research was criticized by anthropologist [[Derek Freeman]], who [[Coming of Age in Samoa#The Mead-Freeman controversy|published a book that argued against many of Mead's conclusions.]]<ref>[[Derek Freeman]] (1983). ''Margaret Mead and Samoa. Cambridge, London: Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-54830-2}}.</ref> Freeman argued that Mead had misunderstood Samoan culture when she argued that Samoan culture did not place many restrictions on youths' sexual explorations. Freeman argued instead that Samoan culture prized female chastity and virginity and that Mead had been misled by her female Samoan informants. Freeman's critique was met with a considerable backlash and harsh criticism from the anthropology community, whereas it was received enthusiastically by communities of scientists who believed that sexual mores were more or less universal across cultures.<ref>{{cite video | title = Margaret Mead and Samoa| year = 1987| author = Frank Heimans| time = 20:25| quote=Roger Fox, Professor of Anthropology, Rutgers: '[What Freeman did was to] attack the goddess... she couldn't be wrong because if she was wrong then the doctrine was wrong and the whole liberal humanitarian scheme was wrong' | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOCYhmnx6o8}}</ref><ref>{{cite video | title = Margaret Mead and Samoa| year = 1987| author = Frank Heimans| time = 21:20| quote = Marc Swartz, Professor of Anthropology, University of California, San Diego: "one of the leading anthropologists came out immediately after Derek's book was out and said I haven't read the book but I know he's wrong" | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOCYhmnx6o8}}</ref> Some anthropologists who studied Samoan culture argued in favor of Freeman's findings and contradicted those of Mead, whereas others argued that Freeman's work did not invalidate Mead's work because Samoan culture had been changed by the integration of Christianity in the decades between Mead's and Freeman's fieldwork periods.<ref>{{cite video | title = Margaret Mead and Samoa| year = 1987| author= Frank Heimans| time = 26:125| quote = Anthropologists Richard Goodman and Tim Omera talk about their work in Samoa and how it supports Freeman's findings| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOCYhmnx6o8}}</ref> While Mead was careful to shield the identity of all her subjects for confidentiality Freeman was able to find and interview one of her original participants, and Freeman reported that she admitted to having willfully misled Mead.  She said that she and her friends were having fun with Mead and telling her stories.<ref>{{cite video | title = Margaret Mead and Samoa| year = 1987| author= Frank Heimans| time = 41:20| quote = We girls would pinch each other and tell her we were out with the boys. We were only joking but she took it seriously. As you know Samoan girls are terrific liars and love making fun of people but Margaret thought it was all true. | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOCYhmnx6o8}}</ref>

On the whole, anthropologists have rejected the notion that Mead's conclusions rested on the validity of a single interview with a single person, finding instead that Mead based her conclusions on the sum of her observations and interviews during her time in Samoa, and that the status of the single interview did not falsify her work.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Shankman |first1=Paul |title=The Trashing of Margaret Mead |publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press |isbn=978-0-299-23454-6 |page=113}}</ref> Some anthropologists have however maintained that even though Freeman's critique was invalid, Mead's study was not sufficiently scientifically rigorous to support the conclusions she drew.<ref>Orans, Martin 1996 ''Not Even Wrong: Margaret Mead, Derek Freeman, and the Samoans.''</ref>

Mead's reputation and significance as an anthropologist have not been diminished by Freeman's criticisms. In her book ''[[Galileo's Middle Finger]]'', [[Alice Dreger]] argues that Freeman's accusations were unfounded and misleading. A detailed review of the controversy by Paul Shankman, published by the University of Wisconsin Press in 2009, supports the contention that Mead's research was essentially correct, and concludes that Freeman cherry-picked his data and misrepresented both Mead and Samoan culture.<ref>{{cite book  | title=The Trashing of Margaret Mead: Anatomy of an Anthropological Controversy| author=Shankman, Paul | year=2009 | publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |  isbn=978-0-299-23454-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1189202|author=Robert A.

==Legacy==
On January 19, 1979, President [[Jimmy Carter]] announced that he was awarding the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] posthumously to Mead. UN Ambassador [[Andrew Young]] presented the award to Mead's daughter at a special program honoring Mead's contributions, sponsored by the American Museum of Natural History, where she spent many years of her career. The citation read:<ref name="medal">{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=32524|title=Jimmy Carter: Presidential Medal of Freedom Announcement of Award to Margaret Mead|date=January 19, 1979|publisher=The American Presidency Project|accessdate=2009-10-20}}</ref>

{{quote|"Margaret Mead was both a student of civilization and an exemplar of it. To a public of millions, she brought the central insight of cultural anthropology: that varying cultural patterns express an underlying human unity. She mastered her discipline, but she also transcended it. Intrepid, independent, plain spoken, fearless, she remains a model for the young and a teacher from whom all may learn."}}

In 1979, the [[Supersisters]] trading card set was produced and distributed; one of the cards featured Mead's name and picture.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wulf |first=Steve |url=http://espn.go.com/espnw/news-commentary/article/12535055/original-roster |title=Supersisters: Original Roster |publisher=Espn.go.com |date=2015-03-23 |accessdate=2015-06-04}}</ref>

The 2006 music video for "[[If Everyone Cared]]" by [[Nickelback]], ends with her quote: "Never doubt that a small group of committed people can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has." This quote is also in the 15th episode of the 4th season of [[The West Wing]]. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

The 2014 novel ''Euphoria'' by [[Lily King]], is a fictionalized account of Mead's love/marital relationships with fellow anthropologists Reo Fortune and Gregory Bateson in pre-WWII New Guinea.  ''Euphoria'' won the Kirkus Prize, and was selected as 'One of the 10 Best Books of the Year' by the New York Times Book Review.

In addition, there are several schools named after Mead in the United States: a [[junior high school]] in [[Elk Grove Village, Illinois]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mead.sd54.org/ |title=Margaret Mead Junior High School |publisher=Mead.sd54.org |accessdate=2013-11-02}}</ref> an [[elementary school]] in [[Sammamish, Washington]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lwsd.org/school/mead/Pages/default.aspx |title=Margaret Mead Elementary (Washington) |publisher=Lwsd.org |date=2010-08-16 |accessdate=2010-09-29}}</ref> and another in [[Sheepshead Bay]], [[Brooklyn, New York]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://schools.nyc.gov/SchoolPortals/21/K209/default.htm |title=P.S. 209 Margaret Mead |publisher=Schools.nyc.gov |date=2009-04-19 |accessdate=2010-09-29}}</ref>

The [[USPS]] issued a stamp of face value 32¢ on 28 May 1998, as part of the [[Celebrate the Century]] stamp sheet series.

In the 1982 movie ''Summer Lovers'', Valérie Quennessen's anthropologist character attributes the following to Margaret Mead: ''Jealousy doesn't show how much you love someone, but how insecure you are.''
