== Studies in Berkeley's philosophy ==
George S. Pappas is known to be a leading Berkeley scholar; his essay “Berkeley and Scepticism”<ref>{{cite journal |last=Pappas |first=G.S. |title=Berkeley and Scepticism |journal=[[Philosophy and Phenomenological Research]] |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=133–149 |year=1999 |doi= 10.2307/2653461|url=}}</ref> was in 1993 awarded the International Berkeley Prize.<ref>See: [http://www.rochester.edu/college/PHL/Berkeleywinners.html Berkeley Prize Winners]. <br> The annual International Berkeley Essay Prize competition was established by [[Colin Murray Turbayne]] and his wife in 1990.</ref> Professor Pappas is a regular participant of International Berkeley Conferences.<ref>[http://georgeberkeley.tamu.edu/conferences.html International Berkeley Conferences]</ref> At one such conference, celebrating the 300th anniversary of George Berkeley’s birth, Mr. Pappas propounded a new approach to the relationship between Berkeley’s anti-abstractionism and "esse est percipi"<ref>To be is to be perceived. A core proposition of Berkeley's ontology.</ref>  principle. On Pappas reading, Berkeley’s two theses — that there are no abstract ideas and that sensible objects must be perceived in order to exist — entail one another.<ref>{{cite conference |last=Pappas |first=G.S. |chapter=Abstract ideas and the 'esse is percipi' thesis |editor-first=D. |editor-last=Berman |title=George Berkeley: Essays and replies |publisher=Irish Academic Press |location=Dublin |year=1985 |isbn=0-7165-2395-7 |pages=47–62 |conference=Proceedings of International Berkeley Conference in Dublin, 1985 |ref={{harvid|Essays and replies|1985}}}}</ref>

{{quote|text = Pappas’ formulation of the relationship between these two propositions is ingenious and merits his verdict that it is a ‘very exciting result’ … So far as I know, his thesis is original. Some writers, to be sure, have some close to suggesting that the first proposition is a necessary condition for the truth of the second, but I cannot think of a commentator who holds that it is both a necessary and sufficient condition.

Pappas' interpretation of Berkeley's ‘''esse'' is ''percipi''’ thesis has sparked much discussion.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Stroll |first=Avrum |title=Two lines of argumentation in Berkeley’s Principles: a reply to George S.

<blockquote>
“That account is put forward to answer an extremely perplexing question in the history of philosophy: Why did Berkeley embrace idealism, i. e., why did he hold that esse est percipi, that to be is to be perceived? {{harv|Hausman|1984|pp=421–2}}</blockquote>

After emerging in the early 1960s, the “inherence account” attracted numerous proponents and became an influential element of contemporary Berkeley scholarship. In his paper “Ideas, minds, and Berkeley”<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pappas |first=G.S. |title=Ideas, minds, and Berkeley |journal=[[American Philosophical Quarterly|Am. Phil. Q.]] |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=181–194 |year=1980 |doi= |url=http://su-ltd.mylivepage.ru/file/2716/6145_Pappas_Ideas%2C_Minds%2C_and_Berkeley.djvu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306000509/http://su-ltd.mylivepage.ru/file/2716/6145_Pappas_Ideas,_Minds,_and_Berkeley.djvu |archivedate=2012-03-06 |df= }}</ref> Pappas revealed some discrepancies between fountain-head evidences and Allaire’s approach to a reconstruction of Berkeley’s idealism. Pappas' critical examination of the “inherence account” is greatly appreciated by Berkeley scholars. Pappas’ penetrating remarks compelled Edwin B. Allaire  to revise and improve his conception.<ref>{{cite book |last=Allaire |first=Edwin B. |chapter=Berkeley’s Idealism Revisited |editor-first=Colin M. |editor-last=Turbayne |title=Berkeley: Critical and Interpretive Essays |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RExF10reT9wC |year=1982 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |isbn=978-0-8166-1066-2 |pages=197–206}}</ref> Even those who share Allaire’s account of Berkeley’s idealism acknowledge Pappas’ article to be “an excellent review and critique of the IA [inherence account].”<ref>{{harvnb|Hausman|1984|p=422 (note 2)}}</ref>

In 2000 George Pappas published his monograph ''Berkeley's thought'' in which some parts were based on earlier papers of his. While writings by [[A. A. Luce]] or [[Geoffrey Warnock]] are long out dated, the book ''Berkeley's thought'' written by Dr Pappas is often included in lists of recommended literature on [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]]’s philosophy.<ref>As examples, take:
