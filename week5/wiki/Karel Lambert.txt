==Lambert's Law==
Lambert's Law is the major principle in any free definite description theory that says: For all x, x = the y (A) if and only if (A(x/y) & for all y (if A then y = x)). Free logic itself is an adjustment of a given standard [[predicate logic]] such as to relieve it of existential assumptions, and so make it a free logic. Taking [[Bertrand Russell]]'s predicate logic in his ''Principia Mathematica'' as standard, one replaces universal instantiation, <math>\forall x \,\phi x \rightarrow \phi y</math>, with universal specification <math>(\forall x \,\phi x \and E!y \,\phi y) \rightarrow \phi z</math>. Thus universal statements, like "All men are mortal," or "Everything is a unicorn," do not presuppose that there are men or that there is anything.  These would be symbolized, with the appropriate predicates, as <math>\forall x\,(Mx \rightarrow Lx)</math> and <math>\forall x\, Ux</math>, which in ''Principia Mathematica'' entail <math>\exists x\,(Mx \and Lx)</math> and <math>\exists x\,Ux</math>, but not in free logic.  The truth of these last statements, when used in a free logic, depend on the [[Domain of discourse|domain of quantification]], which may be the null set.

==Published works==
* ''Philosophical Applications of Free Logic'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1991, "A Theory of Definite Descriptions", pp.&nbsp;17â€“27, details an account of Russell's Theory of Descriptions in free logic. In the process, he demonstrates how a formulation from Hintikka allows for a contradiction by a correlate in logic to Russell's Paradox. He introduces the predicate <math>(\lambda x)(\phi x \and \neg \phi x)</math>
