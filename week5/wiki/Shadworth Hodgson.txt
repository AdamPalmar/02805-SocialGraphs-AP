'''Shadworth Hollway Hodgson''' (1832-1912) was an [[England|English]] [[philosopher]].

He worked independently, without academic affiliation.  He was acknowledged by [[William James]] <ref>http://www.brocku.ca/MeadProject/James/James_1912/James_1912_pref.html</ref> as a forerunner of [[Pragmatism]], although he viewed his work as a completion of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] project.  Hodgson was a member of a London philosophy club with James, called the "Scratch Eight." Hodgson regarded the poets [[William Wordsworth]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] as his chief inspirations, and had no academic background, though he was a member of the [[Metaphysical Society]].

He was the first president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] and held that post from 1880 to 1894.

His principal work was ''The Metaphysic of Experience'' (1898) which prepared the way for New Realism. He objected to the stance of [[empiricism]] in its postulating of persons and things, and insisted that neither subject nor object are warranted as initial considerations of philosophy.

Attention to Hodgson was briefly enlivened by an article by Wolfe Mays in a British Phenomenology journal in the 1970s.

The volumes of Hodgson's principal work were often shipped with uncut pages and visits to libraries with these volumes has revealed that sometimes most pages of all 4 volumes remained uncut even one hundred years later.
