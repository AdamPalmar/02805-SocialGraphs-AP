'''Norman Malcolm''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|æ|l|k|ə|m}}; 11 June 1911 &ndash; 4 August 1990) was an [[United States|American]] [[philosophy|philosopher]].

==Life==
Malcolm was born in [[Selden, Kansas]]. He studied philosophy with [[O.K. Bouwsma]] at the [[University of Nebraska]], then enrolled as a graduate student at [[Harvard University]] in 1933.

At [[Cambridge University]] in 1938-9, he met [[George Edward Moore|G. E. Moore]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. Malcolm attended Wittgenstein's lectures on the [[philosophy|philosophical]] foundations of [[mathematics]] throughout 1939 and remained one of Wittgenstein's closest friends. Malcolm's memoir of his time with Wittgenstein, published in 1958, is widely acclaimed as one of the most captivating and most accurate portraits of Wittgenstein's remarkable personality.

After serving in the [[United States Navy]] from 1942 to 1945, Malcolm, with his wife, Leonida, and their son, Raymond Charles Malcolm, resided in Cambridge again in 1946-47.  He saw a good deal of Wittgenstein during that time, and they continued to correspond frequently thereafter. In 1947,  Malcolm joined the faculty at [[Cornell University]], where he taught until his retirement. In 1949, Wittgenstein was a guest of the Malcolms in [[Ithaca, New York]].  In that year Malcolm introduced [[O.K. Bouwsma]] to Wittgenstein. Bouwsma remained close to Wittgenstein until Wittgenstein's death in 1951.

In 1959, his book ''Dreaming'' was published, in which he elaborated on Wittgenstein's question as to whether it really mattered if people who tell dreams "really had these images while they slept, or whether it merely seems so to them on waking". This work was also a response to Descartes' ''Meditations''.[http://auden.webster.edu/~sekosha/pastor.htm]

Other than that he is known for propagating the view that [[common sense]] philosophy and [[ordinary language]] philosophy are the same. He was generally supportive of [[George Edward Moore|Moore's]] theory of knowledge and certitude, though he found Moore's style and method of arguing to be ineffective.<ref>Norman Malcolm (1952), "Moore and Ordinary Language", ''The Philosophy 
of G. E. Moore''</ref> His critique of Moore's articles on skepticism (and also on Moore's '[[Here is a hand]]' argument) lay the foundation for the renewed interest in common sense philosophy and [[ordinary language philosophy|ordinary language philosoph]]y.<ref>Scott Soames (2003) "Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century, Volume II: The Age of Meaning." ''Chapter 7''</ref>

Malcolm was also a defender of a [[Modal logic|modal]] version of the [[ontological argument]]. In 1960 he argued that the argument originally presented by [[Anselm of Canterbury]] in the second chapter of his ''[[Proslogion]]'' was just an inferior version of the argument propounded in chapter three.<ref>Norman Malcolm (1960), "Anselm's Ontological Arguments," ''Philosophical Review'', '''69''':41&ndash;62.</ref> His argument is similar to those produced by [[Charles Hartshorne]] and [[Alvin Plantinga]]. Malcolm argued that a God cannot simply exist as a matter of contingency but rather must exist in necessity if at all. He argued that if God exists in contingency then his existence is subject to a series of conditions that would then be greater than God and this would be a contradiction (referring to Anselm's definition of God as That than which Nothing Greater can be Conceived).
