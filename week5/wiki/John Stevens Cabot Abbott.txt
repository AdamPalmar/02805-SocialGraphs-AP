'''John Stevens Cabot Abbott''' (September 19, 1805 – June 17, 1877), an American historian, pastor, and pedagogical writer, was born in [[Brunswick, Maine]] to Jacob and Betsey Abbott.

==Early life==
He was a brother of [[Jacob Abbott]], and was associated with him in the management of [[Abbott's Institute]], New York City, and in the preparation of his series of brief historical biographies. Dr. Abbott graduated at [[Bowdoin College]] in 1825, prepared for the ministry at [[Andover Theological Seminary]], and between 1830 and 1844, when he retired from the ministry in the [[Puritan|Congregational Church]], preached successively at [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], [[Roxbury, Massachusetts|Roxbury]] and [[Nantucket, Massachusetts|Nantucket]], all in [[Massachusetts]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Literary career==
Owing to the success of a little work, ''The Mother at Home'', he devoted himself, from 1844 onwards, to literature. He was a voluminous writer of books on Christian ethics, and of popular histories, which were credited with cultivating a popular interest in history. He is best known as the author of the widely popular ''History of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'' (1855), in which the various elements and episodes in Napoleon's career are described.  Abbott takes a very favourable view towards his subject throughout. Also among his principal works are: ''History of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in America'' (1863–1866), and ''The History of Frederick II, Called [[Frederick the Great]]'' (New York, 1871). He also did a forward to a book called Life of Boone by W.M. Bogart, about [[Daniel Boone]] in 1876.

In general, except that he did not write juvenile fiction, his work in subject and style closely resembles that of his brother, [[Jacob Abbott]].

==Marriage and children==
On August 17, 1835 he married Jane Williams Bourne, daughter of Abner Bourne and Abagail Williams. John and Jane had issue: 
#John Brown Abbott (November 29, 1831 &ndash; May 24, 1839)
#Jane Maria Abbott (born November 25, 1833)
#Waldo Abbott (September 8, 1836 &ndash; July 7, 1864)

#Laura Sallucia Abbott (born October 30, 1843)
#Elizabeth Ballister Abbott (March 15, 1847 &ndash; February 23, 1864)
#Emma Susan Abbott (born July 12, 1849)
#Gorham Dummer Abbott (born March 29, 1851)

As a part of the 1872 [[Iwakura Mission]] Mr. Abbott was given guardianship of Shige Nagai, a Japanese girl sent to the United States to be educated.

John Stevens Cabot Abbott died at [[Fair Haven, Connecticut]]. In 1910, a series of twenty short biographies of historical characters by J. S. C. and Jacob Abbott, was published. Their brother, [[Gorham Dummer Abbott]], was also an author. Abbott's grandson, Willis Abbott, was a [[Christian Science|Christian Scientist]] and an editor of the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]''.<ref>[http://www.longyear.org/store/books/bibles-and-bible-reference/history-christianity-john-sc-abbott Sales blurb about ''The History of Christianity''] Longyear Museum.
