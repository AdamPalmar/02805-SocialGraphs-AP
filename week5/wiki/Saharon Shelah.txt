'''Saharon Shelah''' ({{lang-he|שהרן שלח}}) is an Israeli mathematician. He is a professor of [[mathematics]] at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] and [[Rutgers University]] in [[New Jersey]].

==Biography==
Shelah was born in [[Jerusalem]] on July 3, 1945. He is the son of the Israeli poet and political activist [[Yonatan Ratosh]].<ref name="Memoir">{{he icon}} {{cite news | url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/misc/1.691997 | title=זיכרונותיו של בן|trans-title=Memoirs of a Son| last=Shelah | first=Saharon | date=2001-04-05 | newspaper=[[Haaretz]]  | accessdate=2014-08-31 | quote={{lang|he|כשעמדתי להציג לפני חברתי יעל (עתה רעייתי) את בני משפחתי...הפרופ' שהרן שלח מן האוניברסיטה העברית בירושלים, בנו של יונתן רטוש...}} [As I was about to present to friend Yael (now my wife), my family ... Professor Saharon Shelah of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, son of Yonathan Ratosh ...]}}</ref> He received his PhD for his work on stable theories in 1969 from the Hebrew University.<ref name="mg" />

Shelah is married to Yael,<ref name = "Memoir" /> and has three children.<ref>{{hu icon}} {{cite web | url=http://www.matud.iif.hu/01mar/shelah.html | title= Harc a matematikával és a titkárnőkkel | language=hu | trans_title=Struggle with mathematics and the secretaries | last=Réka | first=Szász |date=March 2001 | work=Magyar Tudományos  | accessdate=2014-08-31 | quote=Hungarian: A gyerekei mivel foglalkoznak?

My elder son is learning the theory of music, my daughter history, my younger son biology.)}}</ref>

Shelah wanted to be a scientist while at primary school, but initially was attracted to physics and biology, not mathematics.<ref name="interview">{{cite web |url = http://www.omath.org.il/image/users/112431/ftp/my_files/the_interview.pdf |title = Interview with Saharon Shelah |author = Moshe Klein |publisher= Gan Adam |accessdate = 2014-08-05 }}</ref> Later he found [[mathematical beauty]] in studying geometry: He said, "But when I reached the ninth grade I began studying geometry and my eyes opened to that beauty—a system of demonstration and theorems based on a very small number of axioms which impressed me and captivated me." At the age of 15, he decided to become a mathematician, a choice cemented after reading [[Abraham Fraenkel|Abraham Halevy Fraenkel]]'s book "An Introduction to Mathematics".<ref name="interview" />

He received a B.Sc. from Tel Aviv University in 1964, served in the Israel Defense Forces Army between 1964 and 1967, and obtained a M.Sc. from the Hebrew University (under the direction of Haim Gaifman)  in 1967.<ref name="mactutor">{{cite web |url = http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Shelah.html |title = Saharon Shelah |publisher =School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St Andrews, Scotland |accessdate = 2014-08-05 }}</ref> He then worked as a Teaching Assistant at the Institute of Mathematics of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem while completing a Ph.D. there under the supervision of [[Michael O. Rabin|Michael Oser Rabin]],<ref name="mactutor" /> on a study of stable theories.

Shelah was a Lecturer at Princeton University during 1969-70, and then worked as an Assistant Professor at the University of California, Los Angeles during 1970-71.<ref name="mactutor" /> He became a professor at Hebrew University in 1974, a position he continues to hold.<ref name="mactutor" />

He has been a Visiting Professor at the following Universities:<ref name="mactutor" /> the [[University of Wisconsin]] (1977–78), the [[University of California, Berkeley]] (1978 and 1982), the [[University of Michigan]] (1984–85), at [[Simon Fraser University]], Burnaby, [[British Columbia]] (1985), and [[Rutgers University]], New Jersey (1985).

He has been a [[Distinguished Visiting Professor]] at [[Rutgers University]] since 1986.<ref name="mactutor" />

==Academic career==
Shelah's archive, {{as of|2017|February|lc = yes}} lists 1103 mathematical papers including joint papers with over 220 co-authors.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://shelah.logic.at/listb.html |title = Hyperlinked list of Shelah's papers |accessdate = 2014-08-05 }}</ref> His main interests lie in [[mathematical logic]], [[model theory]] in particular, and in [[axiomatic set theory]].

In [[model theory]], he developed ''classification theory'', which led him to a solution of [[Morley's problem]]. In [[set theory]], he discovered the notion of [[proper forcing axiom|proper forcing]], an important tool in iterated [[forcing (mathematics)|forcing]] arguments. With [[PCF theory]], he showed that in spite of the undecidability of the most basic questions of cardinal arithmetic (such as the [[continuum hypothesis]]), there are still highly nontrivial [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]] theorems about [[cardinal number|cardinal]] exponentiation. Shelah constructed a [[Jonsson group]], an uncountable group for which every proper subgroup is countable. He showed that [[Whitehead's problem]] is [[List of statements undecidable in ZFC|independent of ZFC]]. He gave the first [[primitive recursive]] upper bound to [[Van der Waerden's theorem|van der Waerden's numbers V(C,N)]]. He extended [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] on voting systems.

Shelah's work has had a deep impact on model theory and set theory. The tools he developed for  his classification theory have been applied to a wide number of topics and problems in model theory and have led to great advances in stability theory and its uses in algebra and algebraic geometry as shown for example by [[Ehud Hrushovski]] and many others. Classification theory involves deep work developed in many dozens of  papers to completely solve the spectrum problem on classification of first order theories in terms of structure and number of nonisomorphic models, a huge tour de force. Following that he has extended the work far beyond first order theories, for example for [[Abstract elementary class|Abstract Elementary Classes]]. This work also has had important applications to algebra by works of [[Boris Zilber]].
