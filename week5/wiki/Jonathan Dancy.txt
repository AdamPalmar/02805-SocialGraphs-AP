'''Jonathan Peter Dancy''' (born 8 May 1946) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] philosopher, who has written on [[ethics]] and [[epistemology]].  He is currently Professor of Philosophy at [[University of Texas at Austin]] and Research Professor at the [[University of Reading]].  He taught previously for many years at the [[University of Keele]].

==Education and career==
Dancy was educated at [[Winchester College]], where he was [[Head Boy]] and played cricket for the school, and [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]], where he obtained a double first in classics (1965–7: Classical Honour Moderations: First Class Honours; 1967–9: Literae Humaniores: First Class Honours, BA).<ref name=CV>{{cite web | url=http://www.utexas.edu/cola/files/4071124 | title=Jonathan Dancy | accessdate=16 January 2015}}</ref>

After graduating he served as a lecturer at [[Pembroke College, Oxford]] for a year. In 1971 he became a lecturer at [[Keele University]], becoming professor there in 1991.<ref name=CV/>

After being mentioned by his daughter-in-law, American actress [[Claire Danes]], during an appearance on ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]'', Dancy appeared as a guest on the program on 1 April 2010.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VthiiIhN3wg</ref>

He was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 2016.<ref>http://www.britac.ac.uk/news/british-academy-announces-new-president-and-elects-66-new-fellows</ref>

==Philosophical work==

After having worked on problems of [[epistemology]], and more particularly on the nature of perception ([[argument from illusion]]), he emerged as the leading proponent in ethics of [[moral particularism]], the idea that all moral reasons are particular and context-sensitive, rather than general. He also defends what he calls the [[holism]] of reasons, namely the idea that a consideration that is a reason for acting in a certain way in one case may not be a reason for acting in that way, or even a reason for not acting in that way, in other cases. In this sense, reasons are context-dependent. Dancy argues that the holism of reasons provides a major support for the main claim of his particularism, i.e., that there are no moral ''principles'' but that ''morality'' can get on perfectly well without them. Dancy edited some of [[George Berkeley]] writings<ref name=Parigi>Silvia Parigi. [http://people.hsc.edu/berkeleystudies/berkbib.php Berkeley Bibliography (1979-2010)]</ref> and dedicated a book to the [[Anglo-Irish]] thinker.<ref name=Parigi />

==Personal life==

In 1973 he married Sarah Birley; they have three children: the actor [[Hugh Dancy]] (husband of actress [[Claire Danes]]); Jack Dancy, who runs a travel company; and Kate Redman,<ref>https://www.twitter.com/rougewoman</ref> who works for UNESCO.
