Rabbi '''Shmuel Alexandrov''' of [[Bobruisk]] ({{lang-he|שמואל אלכסנדרוב}}; 1865–1941) was a prominent student of the [[Volozhin Yeshiva]], who became close to the tradition of [[Chabad]] Hasidism. Alexandrov was a [[Orthodox Judaism|Jewish Orthodox]] mystical thinker, philosopher and [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchist]], whose religious thought, an original blending of [[Kabbalah]], [[Orthodox Judaism]], contemporary [[philosophy]] and secular literature, are marked by [[universalism]] and some degree of [[antinomianism]].<ref>Luz, Ehud 1981 "Spiritualism and religious anarchism in the teaching of Shmuel Alexandrov" (Hebrew).

Alexandrov was influenced by the anarchistic implications of the work of [[Rav Kook]] (the first [[Ashkenazi]] chief rabbi of the British [[Mandate for Palestine]]), from which he sought to derive practical instruction.<ref name=kook>{{cite book |last=Ish |first=Shalom |title=Rav Avraham Itzhak Hacohen Kook |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany |year=1993 |isbn=0-7914-1369-1 }}</ref> Another influence on Alexandrov was Russian philosopher [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]].<ref>Konstantin Burmistrov (Institute of Philosophy, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia) ''On the History of Russian-Jewish Intellectual Relations: Vladimir Solovyev and Rabbi Shmuel Alexandrov''</ref> Alexandrov lived all his life in Bobruisk and perished in [[the Holocaust]].<ref name=hamutal>
