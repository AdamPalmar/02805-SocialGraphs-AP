'''Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar''' (14 April 1891&nbsp;– 6 December 1956), popularly known as '''Baba Saheb''', was an Indian jurist, economist, politician and social reformer who inspired the [[Dalit Buddhist Movement]] and campaigned against social discrimination against [[Untouchability|Untouchables]] (''[[Dalit]]s''), while also supporting the rights of women and [[Labour movement|labour]].<ref name="firstpost.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpost.com/politics/rescuing-ambedkar-from-pure-dalitism-he-wouldve-been-indias-best-prime-minister-2195498.html|title=Rescuing Ambedkar from pure Dalitism: He would've been India's best Prime Minister|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106214027/http://www.firstpost.com/politics/rescuing-ambedkar-from-pure-dalitism-he-wouldve-been-indias-best-prime-minister-2195498.html|archivedate=6 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name="Bryant, Edwin 2001. pp. 50-51">Bryant, Edwin.

Ambedkar was a prolific student, earning [[doctorate]]s in economics from both [[Columbia University]] and the [[London School of Economics]], and gained a reputation as a scholar for his research in law, economics and political science.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/archives-released-by-lse-reveal-br-ambedkar-s-time-as-a-scholar/story-N2sq6Bm6OlxwQZkz6vBzvM.html|title=Archives released by LSE reveal BR Ambedkar’s time as a scholar|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160209050301/http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/archives-released-by-lse-reveal-br-ambedkar-s-time-as-a-scholar/story-N2sq6Bm6OlxwQZkz6vBzvM.html|archivedate=9 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In his early career he was an economist, professor, and lawyer. His later life was marked by his political activities; he became involved in campaigning and negotiations for India's independence, publishing journals, advocating political rights and social freedom for Dalits, and contributing significantly to the establishment of the state of India. In 1956 he converted to [[Buddhism]], initiating mass conversions of Dalits.<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert Jr|editor2-last=Lopez|editor2-first=Donald S.

In 1990, the [[Bharat Ratna]], India's highest civilian award, was posthumously conferred upon Ambedkar. Ambedkar's legacy includes numerous memorials and depictions in popular culture.

==Early life==
Ambedkar was  born on 14 April 1891 in the town and military cantonment of [[Mhow]] in  the [[Central Provinces]] (now in [[Madhya Pradesh]]).<ref>{{cite book |last=Jaffrelot |first=Christophe |title = Ambedkar and Untouchability: Fighting the Indian Caste System|year= 2005 |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|location=New York|isbn= 0-231-13602-1 | page=2}}</ref> He was the 14th and last child of Ramji Maloji Sakpal, an army officer who held the rank of [[Subedar]], and Bhimabai Sakpal, daughter of Laxman Murbadkar.<ref name="Columbia">{{cite web| last = Pritchett| first = Frances| url = http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1890s.html| title = In the 1890s| format = PHP| accessdate = 2 August 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060907040421/http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1890s.html| archivedate= 7 September 2006 | deadurl= no}}</ref> His family was of [[Marathi people|Marathi]] background from the town of [[Ambadawe]] ([[Mandangad|Mandangad taluka]]) in [[Ratnagiri (district)|Ratnagiri district]] of modern-day [[Maharashtra]]. Ambedkar was born into a poor low [[Mahar]] (dalit) caste, who were treated as [[Untouchability|untouchables]] and subjected to socio-economic discrimination.<ref>{{cite web |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/357931/Mahar |title=Mahar |publisher=britannica.com |accessdate=12 January 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130060042/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/357931/Mahar |archivedate=30 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Ambedkar's ancestors had long worked for the army of the [[British East India Company]], and his father served in the [[British Indian Army]] at the Mhow cantonment.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ahuja|first=M.

Although they attended school, Ambedkar and other untouchable children were segregated and given little attention or help by teachers. They were not allowed to sit inside the class. When they needed to drink water, someone from a higher caste had to pour that water from a height as they were not allowed to touch either the water or the vessel that contained it. This task was usually performed for the young Ambedkar by the school [[peon]], and if the peon was not available then he had to go without water; he described the situation later in his writings as ''"No peon, No Water"''.<ref name = "Waiting for Visa">{{cite web|others= Frances Pritchett, translator | url= http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/txt_ambedkar_waiting.html |title=Waiting for a Visa|first= B.

Ramji Sakpal retired in 1894 and the family moved to [[Satara district|Satara]] two years later. Shortly after their move, Ambedkar's mother died. The children were cared for by their paternal aunt and lived in difficult circumstances. Three sons&nbsp;– Balaram, Anandrao and Bhimrao&nbsp;– and two daughters&nbsp;– Manjula and Tulasa&nbsp;– of the Ambedkars survived them. Of his brothers and sisters, only Ambedkar passed his examinations and went to high school. His original surname was ''Sakpal'' but his father registered his name to school in ''Ambadawekar'', meaning he comes from his native village '[[Ambadawe]]' in Ratnagiri district.<ref>[http://www.loksatta.com/pune-news/about-name-of-ambadve-village-1227278/  Daily Loksatta News Paper dated -14/04/2016]</ref><ref>[http://www.loksatta.com/pune-news/about-name-of-ambadve-village-1227278/  Daily Loksatta Dated-14/04/2016]</ref><ref>[http://www.loksatta.com/kgtocollege-news/international-standard-educational-complex-at-original-village-of-dr-babasaheb-ambedkar-446635/lite/   Daily Loksatta Dated 18/04/2014]</ref><ref>[https://m.divyamarathi.bhaskar.com/news/MAH-MUM-ambedkars-teacher-family-saving-memories-of-ambedkar-5489831-NOR.html   Daily Divya Marathi NewsPaper Dated 26/12/2016]</ref><ref name = Ambavadekar>{{cite web|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?263871 |title=Bhim, Eklavya |publisher=outlookindia.com |accessdate=17 July 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100811223316/http://outlookindia.com/article.aspx?263871| archivedate= 11 August 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref> His Devrukhe Brahmin teacher, Krishna Keshav Ambedkar, changed his surname from 'Ambadawekar' to his own surname 'Ambedkar' in school records.<ref>[https://m.divyamarathi.bhaskar.com/news/MAH-MUM-ambedkars-teacher-family-saving-memories-of-ambedkar-5489831-NOR.html  Article from Marathi Newspaper]</ref>

==Education==
===Post-secondary education===
In 1897, Ambedkar's family moved to Mumbai where Ambedkar became the only untouchable enrolled at [[Elphinstone High School]]. In 1906, when he was about 15 years old, his marriage to a nine-year-old girl, Ramabai, was [[Arranged marriage in the Indian subcontinent|arranged]].<ref name="Columbia2">{{cite web| last = Pritchett| first = Frances| url = http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1900s.html| title = In the 1900s| format = PHP| accessdate = 5 January 2012| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120106043617/http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1900s.html| archivedate = 6 January 2012| df = dmy-all}}</ref>

===Undergraduate studies at the University of Bombay===
[[File:Young Ambedkar.gif|thumb|upright|Ambedkar as a student]]
In 1907, he passed his matriculation examination and in the following year he entered [[Elphinstone College]], which was affiliated to the [[University of Bombay]], becoming the first untouchable to do so. This success evoked much celebration among untouchables and after a public ceremony, he was presented with a biography of the Buddha by Dada Keluskar, the author and a family friend.<ref name="Columbia2"/>

By 1912, he obtained his degree in economics and political science from Bombay University, and prepared to take up employment with the Baroda state government. His wife had just moved his young family and started work when he had to quickly return to Mumbai to see his ailing father, who died on 2 February 1913.<ref name="Columbia3">{{cite web| last = Pritchett| first = Frances| url = http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1910s.html| title = In the 1910s| format = PHP| accessdate = 5 January 2012| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111123170145/http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1910s.html| archivedate = 23 November 2011| df = dmy-all}}</ref>

===Postgraduate studies at Columbia University===
In 1913, Ambedkar moved to the United States at the age of 22. He had been awarded a Baroda State Scholarship of £11.50 (Sterling) per month for three years under a scheme established by [[Sayajirao Gaekwad III]] ([[Gaekwad]] of [[Princely State of Baroda|Baroda]]) that was designed to provide opportunities for postgraduate education at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]]. Soon after arriving there he settled in rooms at [[Wallach Hall|Livingston Hall]] with Naval Bhathena, a [[Parsi]] who was to be a lifelong friend. He passed his M.A. exam in June 1915, majoring in Economics, and other subjects of Sociology, History, Philosophy and Anthropology. He presented a thesis, ''Ancient Indian Commerce''. Ambedkar was influenced by [[John Dewey]] and his work on democracy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/VGJT8kkl9dGnqWpkgft9QM/Ambedkars-teacher.html|title=Ambedkar teacher|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403032535/http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/VGJT8kkl9dGnqWpkgft9QM/Ambedkars-teacher.html|archivedate=3 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In 1916 he completed his second thesis, ''National Dividend of India-A Historic and Analytical Study'' for another M.A., and finally he received his PhD in Economics in 1927<ref>{{cite web|url=http://c250.columbia.edu/c250_celebrates/remarkable_columbians/bhimrao_ambedkar.html|title=Bhimrao Ambedkar|work=columbia.edu|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210115211/http://c250.columbia.edu/c250_celebrates/remarkable_columbians/bhimrao_ambedkar.html|archivedate=10 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> for his third thesis, after he left for London. On 9 May, he presented the paper ''[[Castes in India: Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development]]'' before a seminar conducted by the anthropologist [[Alexander Goldenweiser (anthropologist)|Alexander Goldenweiser]].

===Postgraduate studies at the London School of Economics===

In October 1916, he enrolled for the [[Bar examination|Bar course]] at [[Gray's Inn]], and at the same time enrolled at the London School of Economics where he started working on a doctoral thesis. In June 1917, he returned to India because his scholarship from Baroda ended. His book collection was dispatched on different ship from the one he was on, and that ship was torpedoed and sunk by a German submarine.<ref name="Columbia3" /> He got permission to return to London to submit his thesis within four years. He returned at the first opportunity, and completed a master's degree in 1921. His thesis was on "The problem of the rupee: Its origin and its solution".<ref name="firstpost.com"/> In 1923, he completed a D.Sc. in Economics, and the same year he was called to the Bar by Gray's Inn. His third and fourth Doctorates (LL.D, Columbia, 1952 and D.Litt., Osmania, 1953) were conferred ''honoris causa''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wx218EFVU8MC&pg=PA163&lpg=PA163&dq=ambedkar%20D'Litt&source=bl&ots=8x9u7TVg4j&sig=1sDv8tzWRC3mZNB-IQNxlO6K7Nc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi7spXG94rNAhWp8YMKHYcDDRQQ6AEIXjAO#v=onepage&q=ambedkar%20D'Litt&f=false|title=Dalit Movement in India and Its Leaders, 1857-1956|first=Rāmacandra|last=Kshīrasāgara|date=1 January 1994|publisher=M.D. Publications Pvt.

==Opposition to Aryan invasion theory==
Ambedkar viewed the [[Shudras]] as Aryan and adamantly rejected the [[Indo-Aryan migration theory|Aryan invasion theory]], describing it as "so absurd that it ought to have been dead long ago" in his 1946 book ''[[Who Were the Shudras?]]''.<ref name="Bryant, Edwin 2001. pp. 50-51"/>

Ambedkar viewed Shudras as originally being "part of the Kshatriya Varna in the Indo-Aryan society", but became socially degraded after they inflicted many tyrannies on [[Brahmins]].<ref>Bryant, Edwin. ''The Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001. pp. 50.</ref>

According to Arvind Sharma, Ambedkar noticed certain flaws in the Aryan invasion theory that were later acknowledged by western scholarship. For example, scholars now acknowledge ''anās''  in [[Rig Veda]] 5.29.10 refers to speech rather than the shape of the [[Human nose|nose]].<ref name="Sharma, Arvind 2005">Sharma, Arvind (2005), ''"Dr. B. R. Ambedkar on the Aryan Invasion and the Emergence of the Caste System in India"'', J Am Acad Relig (September 2005) 73 (3): 849.</ref> Ambedkar anticipated this modern view by stating:

{{quote|The term ''Anasa'' occurs in Rig Veda V.29.10. What does the word mean? There are two interpretations. One is by Prof. Max Muller. The other is by Sayanacharya. According to Prof. Max Muller, it means 'one without nose' or 'one with a flat nose' and has as such been relied upon as a piece of evidence in support of the view that the Aryans were a separate race from the Dasyus. Sayanacharya says that it means 'mouthless,' i.e., devoid of good speech. This difference of meaning is due to difference in the correct reading of the word ''Anasa''. Sayanacharya reads it as ''an-asa'' while Prof. Max Muller reads it as ''a-nasa''. As read by Prof. Max Muller, it means 'without nose.' Question is : which of the two readings is the correct one? There is no reason to hold that Sayana's reading is wrong. On the other hand there is everything to suggest that it is right. In the first place, it does not make non-sense of the word. Secondly, as there is no other place where the Dasyus are described as noseless, there is no reason why the word should be read in such a manner as to give it an altogether new sense. It is only fair to read it as a synonym of ''Mridhravak''. There is therefore no evidence in support of the conclusion that the Dasyus belonged to a different race.<ref name="Sharma, Arvind 2005"/>}}

Ambedkar disputed various hypotheses of the Aryan homeland being [[Indo-Aryan migration theory|outside India]], and concluded the Aryan homeland was India itself.<ref>Sharma, Arvind (2005), ''"Dr. B. R. Ambedkar on the Aryan Invasion and the Emergence of the Caste System in India"'', J Am Acad Relig (September 2005) 73 (3): 851.</ref> According to Ambedkar, the Rig Veda says Aryans, Dāsa and Dasyus were competing religious groups, not different peoples.<ref>Sharma, Arvind (2005), ''"Dr. B. R. Ambedkar on the Aryan Invasion and the Emergence of the Caste System in India"'', J Am Acad Relig (September 2005) 73 (3): 854-5, 863.</ref>

==Opposition to untouchability==
[[File:Ambedkar Barrister.jpg|thumb|upright|Ambedkar as a barrister in 1922]]
As Ambedkar was educated by the Princely State of Baroda, he was bound to serve it. He was appointed Military Secretary to the Gaikwad but had to quit in a short time.

Ambedkar had been invited to testify before the [[Southborough Committee]], which was preparing the [[Government of India Act 1919]].

Ambedkar went on to work as a legal professional. In 1926, he successfully defended three non-Brahmin leaders who had accused the Brahmin community of ruining India and were then subsequently sued for libel. [[Dhananjay Keer]] notes that "The victory was resounding, both socially and individually, for the clients and the Doctor

While practising law in the Bombay High Court, he tried to promote education to untouchables and uplift them.

By 1927, Ambedkar had decided to launch active movements against [[untouchability]]. He began with public movements and marches to open up public drinking water resources. He also began a struggle for the right to enter Hindu temples. He led ''[[Mahad Satyagraha|a satyagraha]]'' in [[Mahad]] to fight for the right of the untouchable community to draw water from the main water tank of the town.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manase.org/en/maharashtra.php?mid=68&smid=23&pmid=1&id=857 |title=Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar |accessdate=26 December 2010 |publisher=Maharashtra Navanirman Sena |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510041016/https://www.manase.org/en/maharashtra.php?mid=68&smid=23&pmid=1&id=857 |archivedate=10 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In a conference in late 1927, Ambedkar publicly condemned the classic Hindu text, the [[Manusmriti]] (Laws of Manu), for ideologically justifying caste discrimination and "untouchability", and he ceremonially burned copies of the ancient text.

In 1930, Ambedkar launched Kalaram Temple movement after three months of preparation. About 15,000 volunteers assembled at [[Kalaram Temple]] satygraha making one of the greatest processions of [[Nashik]].

In 1932, British announced the formation of a separate electorate for "Depressed Classes" in the [[Communal Award]]. [[Gandhi]] fiercely opposed a separate electorate for untouchables, saying he feared that such an arrangement would divide the Hindu community.<ref>{{cite web|title=Poona Pact - 1932|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/469892/Poona-Pact|website=Britannica.com|publisher=''Encyclopædia Britannica''|accessdate=29 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518073354/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/469892/Poona-Pact|archivedate=18 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Ambekar vs Gandhi: A Part That Parted|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article/a-part-that-parted/281929|accessdate=29 April 2015|publisher=Outlook|date=20 August 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427033738/http://www.outlookindia.com/article/a-part-that-parted/281929|archivedate=27 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Museum to showcase Poona Pact|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/Museum-to-showcase-Poona-Pact/articleshow/2400058.cms|accessdate=29 April 2015|publisher=''The Times of India''|date=25 September 2007|quote=Read 8th Paragraph|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017053453/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/Museum-to-showcase-Poona-Pact/articleshow/2400058.cms|archivedate=17 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Gandhi protested by fasting while imprisoned in the [[Yerwada Central Jail]] of [[Poona]].

It had been her long-standing wish to go on a pilgrimage to [[Pandharpur]], but Ambedkar had refused to let her go, telling her that he would create a new Pandharpur for her instead of Hinduism's Pandharpur which treated them as untouchables. At the Yeola Conversion Conference on 13 October in Nasik, Ambedkar announced his intention to convert to a different religion and exhorted his followers to leave [[Hinduism]].<ref name="Columbia5"/> He would repeat his message at many public meetings across India.

In 1936, Ambedkar founded the [[Independent Labour Party (India)|Independent Labour Party]], which contested the 1937 Bombay election to the [[Central Legislative Assembly]] for the 13 reserved and 4 general seats, and secured 11 and 3 seats respectively.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jaffrelot |first1=Christophe |title=Dr Ambedkar and Untouchability: Analysing and Fighting Caste |year=2005 |publisher=C.

In his work ''[[Who Were the Shudras?]]'', Ambedkar tried to explain the formation of untouchables. He saw Shudras and Ati Shudras who form the lowest caste in the ritual hierarchy of the [[Caste system in India|caste system]], as separate from Untouchables. Ambedkar oversaw the transformation of his political party into the [[Scheduled Castes Federation]], although it performed poorly in the 1946 elections for [[Constituent Assembly of India]]. Later he was elected into the constituent assembly of [[Bengal]] where [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] was in power.<ref name="Firstpost 2015">{{cite web | title=Attention BJP: When the Muslim League rescued Ambedkar from the 'dustbin of history' | website=Firstpost | date=15 April 2015 | url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/attention-sanghis-when-the-muslim-league-rescued-ambedkar-from-the-dustbin-of-history-2196678.html | accessdate=5 September 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150920032027/http://www.firstpost.com/india/attention-sanghis-when-the-muslim-league-rescued-ambedkar-from-the-dustbin-of-history-2196678.html | archivedate=20 September 2015 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Ambedkar contested in the Bombay North first Indian General Election of 1952, but lost to his former assistant and Congress Party candidate Narayan Kajrolkar. Ambedkar became a member of Rajya Sabha, probably an appointed member. He tried to enter Lok Sabha again in the by-election of 1954 from Bhandara, but he placed third (the Congress Party won). By the time of the second general election in 1957, Ambedkar had died.

Ambedkar also criticised Islamic practice in South Asia. While justifying the [[Partition of India]], he condemned child marriage and the mistreatment of women in Muslim society.

<blockquote>
No words can adequately express the great and many evils of polygamy and concubinage, and especially as a source of misery to a Muslim woman. Take the caste system. Everybody infers that Islam must be free from slavery and caste. [...] [While slavery existed], much of its support was derived from Islam and Islamic countries. While the prescriptions by the Prophet regarding the just and humane treatment of slaves contained in the Koran are praiseworthy, there is nothing whatever in Islam that lends support to the abolition of this curse. But if slavery has gone, caste among Musalmans [Muslims] has remained.<ref name="Ambedkar">{{cite book |last=Ambedkar |first=Bhimrao Ramji |title= Pakistan or the Partition of India|year= 1946 |publisher=Thackers Publishers|location=Bombay|chapter=Chapter X: Social Stagnation|chapterurl=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar_partition/410.html| pages=215–219| accessdate=8 October 2009}}</ref></blockquote>

Upon India's independence on 15 August 1947, the new Congress-led government invited Ambedkar to serve as the nation's first Law Minister, which he accepted. On 29 August, he was appointed Chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee, and was appointed by the Assembly to write India's new Constitution.<ref>{{cite web|title=Some Facts of Constituent Assembly |work=Parliament of India |publisher=National Informatics Centre |url=http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/debates/facts.htm |quote=On 29 August 1947, the Constituent Assembly set up an Drafting Committee under the Chairmanship of B.

[[Granville Austin]] described the [[Indian Constitution]] drafted by Ambedkar as 'first and foremost a social document'. 'The majority of India's constitutional provisions are either directly arrived at furthering the aim of social revolution or attempt to foster this revolution by establishing conditions necessary for its achievement.'<ref>{{Citation |publisher=Oxford University Press |title = The Indian Constitution: Cornerstone of a Nation |first= Granville |last= Austin |year = 1999 }}</ref>

The text prepared by Ambedkar provided constitutional guarantees and protections for a wide range of [[civil liberties]] for individual citizens, including freedom of religion, the abolition of untouchability, and the outlawing of all forms of discrimination. Ambedkar argued for extensive economic and social rights for women, and won the Assembly's support for introducing a system of [[reservation in India|reservations]] of jobs in the civil services, schools and colleges for members of [[Scheduled Castes and Tribes|scheduled caste]]s and [[scheduled tribe]]s and [[Other Backward Class]], a system akin to [[affirmative action]].<ref>{{Cite news|title= Constituent Assembly Debates Clause wise Discussion on the Draft Constitution 15th November 1948 to 8th January 1949|url= http://www.ambedkar.org/ambcd/63B3.CA%20Debates%2015.11.1948%20to%208.1.1949%20Part%20III.htm|accessdate= 12 January 2012|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130524143208/http://www.ambedkar.org/ambcd/63B3.CA%20Debates%2015.11.1948%20to%208.1.1949%20Part%20III.htm|archivedate= 24 May 2013|df= dmy-all}}</ref> India's lawmakers hoped to eradicate the socio-economic inequalities and lack of opportunities for India's depressed classes through these measures.<ref name=Sheth>{{cite journal|last=Sheth|first=D.

===Opposition to Article 370===
Ambedkar opposed [[Article 370]] of the Constitution of India, which granted a special status to the State of Jammu and Kashmir, and which was included against his wishes. [[Balraj Madhok]] reportedly said, Ambedkar had clearly told the Kashmiri leader, [[Sheikh Abdullah]]: "You wish India should protect your borders, she should build roads in your area, she should supply you food grains, and Kashmir should get equal status as India. But Government of India should have only limited powers and Indian people should have no rights in Kashmir. To give consent to this proposal, would be a treacherous thing against the interests of India and I, as the Law Minister of India, will never do it." Then Sk. Abdullah approached Nehru, who directed him to Gopal Swami Ayyangar, who in turn approached Sardar Patel, saying Nehru had promised Sk. Abdullah the special status. Patel got the Article passed while Nehru was on a foreign tour. On the day the article came up for discussion, Ambedkar did not reply to questions on it but did participate on other articles. All arguments were done by Krishna Swami Ayyangar.<ref name=Jamanadas>{{cite web |last=amanadas |first=Dr. K. |title=Kashmir Problem From Ambedkarite Perspective |url=http://www.ambedkar.org/jamanadas/KashmirProblem1.htm |publisher=ambedkar.org |accessdate=17 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004225153/http://www.ambedkar.org/jamanadas/KashmirProblem1.htm |archivedate=4 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Sehgal|first=Narender|title=Converted Kashmir: Memorial of Mistakes|year=1994|publisher=Utpal Publications|location=Delhi|url=http://www.kashmir-information.com/ConvertedKashmir/Chapter26.html|accessdate=17 September 2013|chapter=Chapter 26: Article 370|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905070936/http://www.kashmir-information.com/ConvertedKashmir/Chapter26.html|archivedate=5 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Tilak |title=Why Ambedkar refused to draft Article 370 |url=http://india.indymedia.org/en/2003/08/6710.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040207095529/http://www.india.indymedia.org/en/2003/08/6710.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 February 2004 |publisher=Indymedia India |accessdate=17 September 2013 }}</ref>

Ambedkar's first wife Ramabai died in 1935 after a long illness. After completing the draft of India's constitution in the late 1940s, he suffered from lack of sleep, had [[neuropathic pain]] in his legs, and was taking [[insulin]] and homoeopathic medicines.

==Conversion to Buddhism==
[[File: Dr. Ambedkar delivering speech during conversion.jpg|thumb|Ambedkar delivering speech during mass conversion]]

Ambedkar considered converting to [[Sikhism]], which encouraged opposition to oppression and so appealed to leaders of scheduled castes. But after meeting with Sikh leaders, he concluded that he might get "second-rate" Sikh status, as described by scholar [[Stephen P. Cohen]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.jstor.org/pss/2943173 |title=The Untouchable Soldier: Caste, Politics, and the Indian Army |first=Stephen P. |last=Cohen |journal=The Journal of Asian Studies |volume=28 |issue=3 |date=May 1969 |page=460 |doi=10.2307/2943173}} {{subscription required}}</ref>

Ambedkar's political philosophy has given rise to a large number of political parties, publications and workers' unions that remain active across India, especially in [[Maharashtra]].
