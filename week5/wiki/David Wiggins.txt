== Work ==

Wiggins is well known for his work in metaphysics, particularly identity (see e.g. ''Sameness and Substance'' (Oxford, 1980).

According to philosopher Harold Noonan:

:The most influential part of Wiggins's work has been in metaphysics, where he has developed a fundamentally Aristotelian conception of substance, enriched by insights drawn from Putnam (1975) and Kripke (1980). His works also contain influential discussions of the problem of personal identity, which Wiggins elucidates ''via'' a conception that he calls the "Animal Attribute View."<ref>Noonan, H., 2005.  "David Wiggins."  In ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. London: Macmillan. [http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3446802122/wiggins-david-1933.html (excerpt)]</ref>
Wiggins is well known for his work in metaphysics, particularly identity (see e.g. ''Sameness and Substance'' (Oxford, 1980).

He has also made an influential contribution to ethics. His 2006 book, ''Ethics.  Twelve Lectures on the Philosophy of Morality'' defends a position he calls "moral objectivism".

He has written widely on other areas including philosophy of language, epistemology, aesthetics and political philosophy.
