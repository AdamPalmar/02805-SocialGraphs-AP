'''Geir Arne Olsen''' (1957 - 1990), better known under his pen-name '''Leonard Borgzinner''', was a Norwegian essayist, self-taught political philosopher, science fiction author, illustrator and [[fanzine]] editor. Borgzinner is most noted for his many contributions to the alternative culture magazine ''[[Gateavisa]]'' and for his two books, a collection of science fiction and fantasy stories, ''Universets varmed√∏d og andre selvmord'' (1981; "The Heat-Death of the Universe and other Suicides") and a collection of essays in political philosophy, ''Anarki og adel: elementer til en kulturrevolusjon'' (1998; "Anarchy and Nobility: Elements towards a Cultural Revolution"). As an illustrator he was known for his often satirical drawings for fanzines and underground publications, including some comic strips. His fanzine production in the late 1970s, still partly under the name of Geir Arne Olsen, spanned both science fiction [[fandom]] and the [[Punk subculture|punk music world]], the former in the fanzines ''TRALFA'' and ''The Borgzinner Medicine Show'', and the latter most notably in the two published issues of ''666'', published in opposition to the Norwegian punk establishment. Influences on his work included [[Pre-Socratic philosophy]], [[Marquis de Sade]], [[anarchism]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[William S. Burroughs]], [[New Wave (science fiction)|new wave science fiction]], [[Samuel R. Delany]], [[Yukio Mishima]] and [[Michel Foucault]].
