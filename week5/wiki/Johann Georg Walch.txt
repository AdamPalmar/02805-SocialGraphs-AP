'''Johann Georg Walch''' (June 17, 1693 – January 13, 1775) was a [[Germany|German]] Lutheran [[theology|theologian]].
==Life==
He was born at [[Meiningen]], where his father, Georg Walch, was general superintendent.  He studied at [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]] and [[University of Jena|Jena]], amongst his teachers being [[Johann Franz Buddeus|JF Buddeus]], whose only daughter he married. He published in 1716 a work, ''Historia critica [[Latin]]ae linguae'', which soon came into wide use. Two years later he became professor extraordinarius of [[philosophy]] at [[university of Jena|Jena]]. In 1719, he was appointed professor ordinarius of [[rhetoric]], in 1721 of [[poetry]], and in 1724 professor extraordinarius of [[theology]]. In 1728 he became professor ordinarius of theology, and in 1750 professor primarius.

His theological position was that of moderate [[Lutheran orthodoxy|orthodoxy]], greatly influenced by the philosophy and controversies of the [[deism|Deistic]] period. His university lectures and published works ranged over the wide fields of church history in its various branches, particularly the literature and the controversies of the church, dogmatics, ethics and pastoral theology.

Of his works the most valuable were ''Bibliotheca theologica'' (1757–1765); ''Bibliotheca patristica'' (1770); his edition of [[Martin Luther|Luther]]'s works in 24 vols. (1740–1752); ''Historische und theologische Einleitung in die religiösen Streitigkeiten, welche sonderlich ausser der evangelische-lutherischen Kirche entstanden'' (5 vols., 1733 ff.); the companion work to this, ''Einleitung in die Religionsstreitigkeiten der evangel.-luth. Kirche'' (1730–1739), and ''Philosophisches Lexikon'' (1726, 4th ed. 1775).

Also important is the ''Historia logicae'', published at Leipzig in 1721.

His life, with a complete list of his writings, which amounted to 287, ''Leben und Charakter des Kirchenraths J. G. Walch'', was published anonymously by his son CWF Walch (Jena, 1777). Cf. [[Wilhelm Gass]], ''Protestantische Dogmatik'', iii. p.&nbsp;205 sq.

His sons, [[Johann Ernst Immanuel Walch|Johann Ernst Immanuel]] and [[Christian Wilhelm Franz Walch]] were also noted theologians.

Johann Georg Walch died in [[Jena]], [[Germany]], on 13 January 1775 at 81 years of age.
