'''Ānandavardhana''' (820–890) was the author of ''Dhvanyāloka'', a work articulating the philosophy of "aesthetic suggestion". The philosopher [[Abhinavagupta]] wrote an important commentary on it.

Ānandavardhana is credited with creating the ''dhvani'' theory. He wrote of ''dhvani'' (meaning sound, or [[resonance]]) in regard to the "soul of poetry."<ref name = "premnath_p11">{{Citation| last = Premnath | first = Devadasan  | last2  = Foskett (Ed.) | first2 = Mary | last3 = Kuan (Ed.) | first3 = Kah-Jin | title = Ways of Being, Ways of Reading: Asian American Biblical Interpretation | publisher = Chalice Press | date = 15 November 2006 | pages = 11 | isbn = 978-0-8272-4254-8}}</ref> "When the poet writes," said Ānandavardhana, "he creates a resonant field of emotions."  To understand the poetry, the reader or hearer must be on the same "[[wavelength]]."  The method requires sensitivity on the parts of the writer and the reader.<ref name = "premnath_p11"/> The complete ''Dhvanyāloka'' together with Abhinavagupta's commentary on it has been translated into English by the eminent sanskritist [[Daniel H.

==Assessment by Modern Sanskritists==
Modern Sanskritists have a very high opinion of Ānandavardhana. Commenting on Ānandavardhana's ''Dhvanyaloka'', [[Pandurang Vaman Kane|P.V. Kane]] writes that  "the Dhvanyāloka is an epoch-making work in the history of Alaṅkāra literature. It occupies the same position in poetics as Pāṇini's Aṣtādhyāyī in grammar and Śaṅkarācarya's commentary on Vedānta".<ref>P. N. K Bamzai, [http://www.koausa.org/Vitasta/1a.html "Kashmir—The Home of Sanskrit Language and Literature"]. Kashmiri Overseas Assoc.</ref> And [[Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Sr.|Daniel H.H. Ingalls]] calls Ānandavardhana 'the most brilliant of all Sanskrit critics'.<ref>{{citation | title = An Anthology of Sanskrit Court Poetry |author1=Vidyakara | author2=Daniel H.H.
