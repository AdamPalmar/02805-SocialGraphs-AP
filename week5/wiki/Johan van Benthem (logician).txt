He was awarded the [[Spinozapremie]] in 1996<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.nwo.nl/en/research-and-results/programmes/spinoza+prize/spinoza+laureates/overview+by+year/1996 |title=NWO Spinoza Prize 1996 |publisher=Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research |date=11 September 2014 |accessdate=30 January 2016}}</ref> and elected a Foreign Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts & Sciences]] in 2015.

He studied [[physics]] ([[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc.]] 1969), [[philosophy]] ([[Master of Arts|M.A.]] 1972) and [[mathematics]] ([[Master of Science|M.Sc.]] 1973) at the University of Amsterdam and received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] from the same university under supervision of [[Martin Löb]] in 1977. Before becoming University Professor in 2003, he held appointments at the University of Amsterdam (1973–1977), at the [[University of Groningen]] (1977–1986), and as a [[professor]] at the University of Amsterdam (1986–2003).

Van Benthem is known for his research in the area of [[modal logic]]. This research has resulted in [[Van Benthem's Theorem]], which states that modal logic is the fragment of [[first-order logic]] that is [[closure (mathematics)|closed under]] [[bisimulation]].

He has also been active in the fields of [[philosophy of science]], logical structures in natural language ([[generalized quantifier]]s, [[categorial grammar]], substructural [[proof theory]]), [[Dynamic logic (modal logic)|dynamic logic]] and [[update logic]] and applications of [[logic]] to [[game theory]] as well as applications of [[game theory]] to [[logic]] ([[game semantics]]). Van Benthem is a member of the group collectively publishing under the [[pseudonym]] [[L. T. F. Gamut]]. He has also taught in China. He made an effort to encourage and organize international collaboration between Chinese and Western logicians.

Professor van Benthem retired from the [[Institute for Logic, Language and Computation]] in  September 2014.
