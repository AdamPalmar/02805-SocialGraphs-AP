==Philosophical work==

Lehrer is best known for his defense of a coherentist theory of knowledge.  According to Lehrer, "a person is justified in accepting a proposition just in case that proposition coheres with the relevant part of her cognitive system."<ref>http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justep-coherence/#OthAccCoh</ref>

Lehrer's work, "Why Not Skepticism?" is used in many introductory philosophy courses as a coherent and readable introduction to the subject. He has authored seven books on philosophical subjects, and over 170 scholarly articles. Lehrer is perhaps best known for his defense of the [[coherentism|coherence]] [[theory of justification]] in epistemology. He is the originator of the widely discussed [http://faculty.fordham.edu/nballantyne/truetemp.html TrueTemp example].
