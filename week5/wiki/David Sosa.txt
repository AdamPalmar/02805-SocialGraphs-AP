'''David Sosa''' is an [[American philosophy|American philosopher]] who is currently Professor of Philosophy and Chair of the Department of Philosophy at the [[University of Texas, Austin]]. He received his [[undergraduate degree]] from [[Brown University]] and a doctorate in philosophy from [[Princeton University]]. His [[PhD]] dissertation, completed in 1996 under the supervision of [[Mark Johnston (philosopher)]], was titled "Representing Thoughts and Language".  Before moving to [[Texas]], Sosa was a post-doctoral fellow at [[U.C. Berkeley]] and an assistant professor of philosophy at [[Dartmouth College]].  He is the son of the philosopher [[Ernest Sosa]].

Sosa appeared in [[Richard Linklater]]'s film ''[[Waking Life]]'',<ref>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1102267/</ref> in which he performed a short monologue on the implications of discoveries in [[physics]] on the problem of [[free will]]. He explained the view, often called ''[[hard determinism]]'', which holds that there is no place for free action in a world governed by physical laws since human beings, like everything else in the physical world, are physical things and are thus subject to these same laws.
