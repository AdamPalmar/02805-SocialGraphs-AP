==Scientific career==
After holding post-doctoral research positions in the United Kingdom and the United States, he taught at [[University of Sussex|Sussex University]] and the [[University of Cambridge]], where he was the [[Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy|Plumian Professor]] until 1991, and the director of the [[Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge|Institute of Astronomy]].

From 1992 to 2003, he was Royal Society Research Professor, and from 2003 Professor of [[physical cosmology|Cosmology]] and [[Astrophysics]]. He was Professor of Astronomy at [[Gresham College]], London, in 1975 and became a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1979. He holds Visiting Professorships at [[Imperial College London]] and at the [[University of Leicester]] and is an Honorary Fellow of [[Darwin College, Cambridge]] and [[Jesus College, Cambridge]].{{cn|date=March 2016}}

Lord Rees has received honorary degrees from a number of universities including Sussex, Uppsala, Toronto, Durham, Oxford, Yale, Melbourne and Sydney. He belongs to several foreign academies, including the US National Academy of Sciences, the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Pontifical Academy of Sciences and the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.knaw.nl/en/members/foreign-members/4688 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160214092416/https://www.knaw.nl/en/members/foreign-members/4688|title=M.J. Rees|publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences|archivedate=14 February 2016|accessdate=14 February 2016}}</ref> 

He has been President of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] (1992–94) and the [[British Association]] (1995–96), and was a Member of Council of the [[Royal Institution of Great Britain]] until 2010. Rees is the author of more than 500 research papers, and he has made important contributions to the origin of [[cosmic microwave background radiation]], as well as to [[galaxy]] clustering and formation. His studies of the distribution of [[quasar]]s led to final disproof of [[Steady State theory]].<ref name="microsoft"/>

He was one of the first to propose that enormous [[black hole]]s power quasars,<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Rees|first1=M.J.|authorlink=Martin Rees, Baron Rees of Ludlow|doi=10.1146/annurev.aa.22.090184.002351|title=Black Hole Models for Active Galactic Nuclei|journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=22|pages=471–506|year=1984|bibcode=1984ARA&A..22..471R}}</ref> and that [[Faster-than-light|superluminal]] astronomical observations can be explained as an [[optical illusions|optical illusion]] caused by an object moving partly in the direction of the observer.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Rees|first1=M.J.|authorlink=Martin Rees, Baron Rees of Ludlow| title=Appearance of Relativistically Expanding Radio Sources|doi=10.1038/211468a0|journal=Nature|volume=211|issue=5048|pages=468–70|year=1966|bibcode=1966Natur.211..468R}}</ref>

In recent years, Lord Rees has worked on gamma-ray bursts, especially in collaboration with Peter Mészáros, and on how the "cosmic dark ages" ended when the first stars formed. In a more speculative vein, he has, since the 1970s, been interested in anthropic reasoning, and the possibility that our visible universe is part of a vaster "[[multiverse]]". {{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Lord Rees is an author of books on [[astronomy]] and science intended for the lay public and gives many public lectures and broadcasts. In 2010 he was chosen to deliver the Reith Lectures for the [[BBC]],<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00sj9lh The Reith Lectures 2010: The Scientific Citizen by Martin Rees], bbc.co.uk; accessed 31 August 2014.</ref> now published as ''From Here to Infinity: Scientific Horizons''.

In 2005, Rees was elevated to a [[life peer]]age, sitting as a [[crossbencher]] in the [[House of Lords]] as '''Baron Rees of Ludlow''', of [[Ludlow]] in the [[Shropshire|County of Shropshire]].<ref>[http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/dp/2005080101 Sir Martin Rees appointed to the House of Lords], admin.cam.ac.uk, 1 August 2005; accessed 31 August 2014.</ref> In 2005, he was awarded the Crafoord Prize.<ref>[http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/dp/2005020801 Professor Sir Martin Rees wins Crafoord Prize], admin.cam.ac.uk, 10 February 2005; accessed 31 August 2014.</ref>

Aside from expanding his scientific interests, Rees has written and spoken extensively about the problems and challenges of the 21st century, and the interfaces between science, ethics and politics.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,,1794321,00.html "Dark Materials: The legacy of Joseph Rotblat"], guardian.co.uk; accessed 31 August 2014.</ref><ref>[http://www.21school.ox.ac.uk/downloads/podcasts/200902_rees.mp3 Podcast of Lecture "The World in 2050"], given at the [[James Martin 21st Century School]], 21school.ox.ac.uk, February 2009.</ref> He is a member of the Board of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]], in Princeton, the [[IPPR]], the [[Oxford Martin School]] and the Gates Cambridge Trust.

In August 2014, Lord Rees of Ludlow was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to ''[[The Guardian]]'' opposing [[Scottish independence]] in the run-up to September's [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014|referendum on that issue]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/07/celebrities-open-letter-scotland-independence-full-text|title=Celebrities' open letter to Scotland|publisher=theguardian.com|date=7 August 2014|accessdate=26 August 2014}}</ref>

In 2015, he was co-author of the report that launched the [[Global Apollo Programme]], which calls for developed nations to commit to spending 0.02% of their GDP for 10 years, to fund co-ordinated research to make [[Renewable energy|carbon-free]] [[Base load power plant|baseload electricity]] less costly than [[Fossil fuel power station|electricity from coal]] by the year 2025.<ref name="Guardian">{{cite news|last1=Carrington|first1=Damian|title=Global Apollo programme seeks to make clean energy cheaper than coal|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/02/apollo-programme-for-clean-energy-needed-to-tackle-climate-change|accessdate=2 June 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|issue=2 June 2015|publisher=[[Guardian News Media]]}}</ref>
