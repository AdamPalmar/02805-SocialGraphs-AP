'''Alexander Sergeyevich Esenin-Volpin''' (also written Ésénine-Volpine and Yessenin-Volpin in his French and English publications; {{lang-ru|Алекса́ндр Серге́евич Есе́нин-Во́льпин|p=ɐlʲɪˈksandr sʲɪrˈɡʲejɪvʲɪtɕ jɪˈsʲenʲɪn ˈvolʲpʲɪn|a=Alyeksandr Syergyeyevich Yesyenin-Vol'pin.ru.vorb.oga}}; May 12, 1924{{spaced ndash}}March 16, 2016) was a prominent Russian-American [[poet]] and [[mathematician]]. A notable [[dissident]], [[political prisoner]] and a leader of the Soviet [[human rights]] movement, he spent a total of fourteen years incarcerated and repressed by the Soviet authorities in prisons, [[psikhushka]]s and exile.

== Life ==
Alexander Volpin was born on May 12, 1924 in the [[Soviet Union]]. His mother, Nadezhda Volpin, was a poet and translator from French and English. His father was [[Sergei Yesenin]],<ref name="Zdravkovska">{{cite book|last1=Zdravkovska|first1=Smilka|last2=Duren|first2=Peter|title=Golden years of Moscow mathematics|year=1993|publisher=AMS Bookstore|isbn=0-8218-9003-4|pages=221|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=esJxwK26zE4C&printsec=frontcover#PPA221,M1}}</ref>{{rp|221}} a celebrated Russian poet, who never knew his son. Alexander and his mother moved from Leningrad to Moscow in 1933.

His first [[Political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union|psychiatric imprisonments]] took place in 1949<ref name="Gilligan">{{cite book|last=Gilligan |first=Emma |title=Defending human rights in Russia: Sergei Kovalyov, dissident and human rights commissioner, 1969–2003 |year=2004 |publisher=RoutledgeCurzon |isbn=0-415-32369-X |pages=20 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QlJNt_10xxAC |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511093536/https://books.google.com/books?id=QlJNt_10xxAC |archivedate=2016-05-11 |df= }}</ref>{{rp|20}} for "anti-Soviet poetry", in 1959 for smuggling abroad [[samizdat]], including his ''Свободный философский трактат'' (''Free Philosophical Tractate''), and again in 1968.

Esenin-Volpin graduated from [[Moscow State University]] with a [[Candidate of Sciences|“candidate”]] dissertation in mathematics in the spring of 1949. After graduation, Volpin was sent to the Ukrainian city of [[Chernovtsy]] to teach mathematics at the local state university. Less than a month after his arrival in Chernovtsy he was  arrested by the [[Ministry for State Security (Soviet Union)|MGB]], sent on a plane back to Moscow, and incarcerated in the [[Lubyanka Building|Lubyanka prison]]. He was charged with "systematically conducting anti-Soviet agitation, writing anti-Soviet poems, and reading them to acquaintances."<ref name=nathans-dicatorship>{{Cite journal|volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=630–663 |last=Nathans |first=Benjamin |title=The Dictatorship of Reason: Aleksandr Vol’pin and the Idea of Human Rights under Developed Socialism |journal=Slavic Review |year=2007 |jstor=20060376 |url=https://www.history.upenn.edu/sites/www.history.upenn.edu/files/nathans_dictatorship-of-reason.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907202452/https://www.history.upenn.edu/sites/www.history.upenn.edu/files/nathans_dictatorship-of-reason.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-07 |df= }}</ref>{{rp|639}}

Apprehensive about the prospect of prison and labor camp, Volpin faked a suicide attempt in order to initiate a psychiatric evaluation.<ref name=kirk>Irina Kirk, ''Profiles in Russian Resistance'' (New York, 1975)</ref>{{rp|119–21}} Psychiatrists at Moscow's [[Serbsky Center|Serbsky Institute]] declared Volpin mentally incompetent, and in October 1949 he was transferred to the Leningrad Psychiatric Prison Hospital for an indefinite stay. A year later he was abruptly released from the prison hospital, and sentenced to five years exile in the Kazakh town of Karaganda as a "socially dangerous element." In Karagada, he found employment as a teacher of evening and correspondence courses in mathematics.

In 1953, after the death of [[Joseph Stalin]], Volpin was released due to a general amnesty. Soon he became a known mathematician specializing in the fields of [[ultrafinitism]] and [[intuitionism]].

===The Glasnost demonstration===

In 1965, Esenin-Volpin organized a legendary "[[Glasnost Meeting|glasnost meeting"]] ("митинг гласности"), a demonstration at Pushkin Square in the center of [[Moscow]] demanding an open and fair trial for the arrested writers [[Andrei Sinyavsky]] and [[Yuli Daniel]]. The leaflets written by Volpin and distributed through [[samizdat]] asserted that the accusations and their closed-door trial were in violation of the 1936 Soviet Constitution and the more recent RSFSR Criminal Procedural Code.

The meeting was attended by about 200 people, many of whom turned out to be [[KGB]] operatives. The slogans read: "Требуем гласности суда над Синявским и Даниэлем" (We demand an [[Public trial|open trial]] for Sinyavski and Daniel) and "Уважайте советскую конституцию" (Respect the Soviet constitution).<ref>[http://www.memo.ru/history/diss/books/ALEXEEWA/Chapter16a.htm {{ru-icon}} Text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051027062200/http://www.memo.ru/history/diss/books/ALEXEEWA/Chapter16a.htm |date=2005-10-27 }}</ref> The demonstrators were promptly arrested.

[Volpin] would explain to anyone who cared to listen a simple but unfamiliar idea: all laws ought to be understood in exactly the way they are written and not as they are interpreted by the government and the government ought to fulfill those laws to the letter [...]. What would happen if citizens acted on the assumption that they have rights? If one person did it, he would become a martyr; if two people did it, they would be labeled an enemy organization; if thousands of people did it, the state would have to become less oppressive.

In the following years, Esenin-Volpin became an important voice in the human rights movement in the Soviet Union. He was one of the first [[Soviet dissidents]] who took on a "legalist" strategy of dissent. He proclaimed that it is possible and necessary to defend human rights by strictly observing the law, and in turn demand that the authorities observe the formally guaranteed rights. Esenin-Volpin was again hospitalized in February 1968 as one of those protesting most strongly against the trial of [[Alexander Ginzburg]] and [[Yuri Galanskov|Yury Galanskov]] ([[Galanskov-Ginzburg trial]]).<ref>[https://chronicleofcurrentevents.net/2013/09/28/1-3-repression-in-response-to-protests-about-trial/ ''A Chronicle of Current Events'' (1.3, item 2), 30 April 1968, "Repressive measures".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815192741/https://chronicleofcurrentevents.net/2013/09/28/1-3-repression-in-response-to-protests-about-trial/ |date=15 August 2016 }}</ref>

After his 1968 psychiatric confinement, 99 Soviet mathematicians sent a letter to the Soviet authorities asking for his release.<ref name="letter-99">{{ru-icon}} [http://www.math.ru/history/p99/index.htm Text of the letter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226085146/http://www.math.ru/history/p99/index.htm |date=2014-02-26 }}. math.ru.

In 1968, Esenin-Volpin circulated his famous "Памятка для тех, кому предстоят допросы" (Memo for those who expect to be interrogated) widely used by fellow dissidents.<ref>[http://www.warning.dp.ua/bezop78.htm {{ru-icon}} Text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526131431/http://www.warning.dp.ua/bezop78.htm |date=2010-05-26 }}</ref>

In 1969, he signed the first ''Appeal to The UN Committee for Human Rights'', drafted by the [[Initiative Group for the Defense of Human Rights in the USSR]].<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Yakobson, Anatoly |author2=Yakir, Pyotr |author3=Khodorovich, Tatyana |author4=Podyapolskiy, Gregory |author5=Maltsev, Yuri |title=An Appeal to The UN Committee for Human Rights |journal=[[The New York Review of Books]] |date=21 August 1969 |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1969/aug/21/an-appeal-to-the-un-committee-for-human-rights/ |display-authors=etal |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151007004956/http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1969/aug/21/an-appeal-to-the-un-committee-for-human-rights/ |archivedate= 7 October 2015 |df= }}</ref> In 1970, Volpin joined the [[Committee on Human Rights in the USSR]] and worked with [[Yuri Feodorovich Orlov|Yuri Orlov]], [[Andrei Sakharov]] and other activists.

===Emigration===

In May 1972, he emigrated to the [[United States]], but his Soviet citizenship was not revoked as was customary at the time. He worked at [[Boston University]]. In 1973 he was one of the signers of the [[Humanist Manifesto II|Humanist Manifesto]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II |title=Humanist Manifesto II |publisher=American Humanist Association |accessdate=October 9, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020110719/http://www.americanhumanist.org/humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II |archivedate=October 20, 2012 |df= }}</ref>

Abroad he again alarmed the Soviet authorities in 1977 by threatening to sue them for spreading rumours that he was mentally ill.<ref>[https://bukovskyarchive.wordpress.com/2016/07/03/26-january-1977-st-4218/ The Bukovsky Archives, 26 January 1977 (St 42/18).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013173559/https://bukovskyarchive.wordpress.com/2016/07/03/26-january-1977-st-4218/ |date=13 October 2016 }}</ref>

In 2005, Esenin-Volpin participated in "[[They Chose Freedom]]", a four-part television documentary on the history of the Soviet dissident movement.

He died on March 16, 2016, aged 91.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/aleksandr-yesenin-volpin-dissident-dead-soviet/27616399.html |title=Aleksandr Yesenin-Volpin, Prominent Soviet-Era Dissident, Dies Aged 91 |date=2016-03-16 |newspaper=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty |language=English |access-date=2016-03-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316232555/http://www.rferl.org/content/aleksandr-yesenin-volpin-dissident-dead-soviet/27616399.html |archivedate=2016-03-16 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.globalpost.com/article/6746978/2016/03/16/early-soviet-dissident-alexander-esenin-volpin-dies-91 |title=Early Soviet dissident Alexander Esenin-Volpin dies at 91 |website=GlobalPost |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]] |access-date=2016-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324125240/http://www.globalpost.com/article/6746978/2016/03/16/early-soviet-dissident-alexander-esenin-volpin-dies-91 |archivedate=2016-03-24 |df= }}</ref>

==Mathematical work==

{{quotebox|right|width=70%
|quote=
I have seen some ultrafinitists go so far as to challenge the existence of 2<sup>100</sup> as a natural number, in the sense of there being a series of “points” of that length. There is the obvious “draw the line” objection, asking where in 2<sup>1</sup>, 2<sup>2</sup>, 2<sup>3</sup>, … , 2<sup>100</sup> do we stop having “Platonistic reality”? Here this … is totally innocent, in that it can be easily be replaced by 100 items (names) separated by commas. I raised just this objection with the (extreme) ultrafinitist Yessenin-Volpin during a lecture of his. He asked me to be more specific. I then proceeded to start with 2<sup>1</sup> and asked him whether this is “real” or something to that effect. He virtually immediately said yes. Then I asked about 2<sup>2</sup>, and he again said yes, but with a perceptible delay. Then 2<sup>3</sup>, and yes, but with more delay. This continued for a couple of more times, till it was obvious how he was handling this objection. Sure, he was prepared to always answer yes, but he was going to take 2<sup>100</sup> times as long to answer yes to 2<sup>100</sup> then he would to answering 2<sup>1</sup>. There is no way that I could get very far with this.

His early work was in general topology, where he introduced [[Esenin-Volpin's theorem]]. Most of his later work was on the foundations of mathematics, where he introduced [[ultrafinitism]], an extreme form of constructive mathematics that casts doubt on the existence of not only infinite sets, but even of large integers such as 10<sup>12</sup>.
He sketched a program for proving the consistency of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] using ultrafinitistic techniques in {{harv|Ésénine-Volpine|1961}}, {{harv|Yessenin-Volpin|1970}} and {{harv|Yessenin-Volpin|1981}}.
