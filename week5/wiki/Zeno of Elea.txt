'''Zeno of [[Velia|Elea]]''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|iː|n|oʊ|_|ə|v|_|ˈ|ɛ|l|i|ə}}; {{lang-el|[[wikt:Ζήνων|Ζήνων]] ὁ Ἐλεάτης}}; c. 490 – c. 430 BC) was a [[pre-Socratic]] Greek [[philosopher]] of [[Magna Graecia]] and a member of the [[Eleatic School]] founded by [[Parmenides]].  [[Aristotle]] called him the inventor of the [[dialectic]].<ref>[[Diogenes Laërtius]], 8.57, 9.25</ref> He is best known for his [[Zeno's paradoxes|paradoxes]], which [[Bertrand Russell]] has described as "immeasurably subtle and profound."<ref>Russell (1996 [1903]), p. 347: "In this capricious world nothing is more capricious than posthumous fame. One of the most notable victims of posterity's lack of judgement is the Eleatic Zeno. Having invented four arguments all immeasurably subtle and profound, the grossness of subsequent philosophers pronounced him to be a mere ingenious juggler, and his arguments to be one and all sophisms. After two thousand years of continual refutation, these sophisms were reinstated, and made the foundation of a mathematical renaissance..."</ref>

== Life ==
Little is known for certain about Zeno's life. Although written nearly a century after Zeno's death, the primary source of biographical information about Zeno is [[Plato]]'s ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]''<ref>[[Plato]] (c. 380 – 367 BC). [http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/parmenides.html ''Parmenides''], translated by [[Benjamin Jowett]]. Internet Classics Archive.</ref> and he is also mentioned in Aristotle's ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]''.<ref>Aristotle (c. mid 4th century BC), ''Physics'' 233a and 239b</ref> In the dialogue of ''Parmenides'', Plato describes a visit to [[Classical Athens|Athens]] by Zeno and Parmenides, at a time when Parmenides is "about 65,"  Zeno is "nearly 40" and [[Socrates]] is "a very young man".<ref name=parm>Plato, ''Parmenides'' 127b–e</ref> Assuming an age for Socrates of around 20, and taking the date of Socrates' birth as 469 BC gives an approximate date of birth for Zeno of 490 BC. Plato says that Zeno was "tall and fair to look upon" and was "in the days of his youth … reported to have been beloved by Parmenides."<ref name=parm />

Other perhaps less reliable details of Zeno's life are given by [[Diogenes Laërtius]] in his ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'',<ref>[[Diogenes Laërtius]]. ''The Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers'', translated by C.D. Yonge. London: Henry G. Bohn, 1853. [http://classicpersuasion.org/pw/diogenes/dlzeno-eleatic.htm Scanned and edited for Peithô's Web.]</ref> where it is reported that he was the son of Teleutagoras, but the adopted son of Parmenides, was "skilled to argue both sides of any question, the universal critic," and that he was arrested and perhaps killed at the hands of a tyrant of [[Velia|Elea]].

According to [[Diogenes Laertius]], Zeno conspired to overthrow [[Nearchus of Elea|Nearchus the tyrant]].<ref name="ReferenceA">Diogenes Laertius, ''Lives of Eminent Philosophers''. Book IX.5.26</ref> Eventually, Zeno was arrested and tortured.<ref>[[Boethius]], [[The Consolation of Philosophy]]. Book 1.III</ref> According to [[Valerius Maximus]], when he was tortured to reveal the name of his colleagues in conspiracy, Zeno refused to reveal their names, although he said he did have a secret that would be advantageous for Nearchus to hear. When Nearchus leaned in to listen to the secret, Zeno bit his ear. He "did not let go until he lost his life and the tyrant lost that part of his body."<ref>[[Valerius Maximus]], ''Memorable Deeds and Sayings.'' Foreign Stories 3. ''ext.'' 3.</ref><ref name="books.google.ca">{{cite book |last=Maximus |first=Valerius |last2=Walker |first2=Henry J.  |year=2004 |title=Memorable Deeds and Sayings: One Thousand Tales from Ancient Rome |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5imDC6VN-FcC&pg=PA97 97]|publisher=Hackett Pub.|isbn=978-0-87220-674-8}}</ref> Within ''Men of the Same Name'', Demetrius said it was the nose that was bit off instead.<ref>Diogenes Laertius, ''Lives of Eminent Philosophers''. Book IX.5.27</ref>

Zeno may have also interacted with other tyrants. According to Laertius, [[Heraclides Lembus]], within his ''[[Satyrus the Peripatetic|Satyrus]]'', said these events occurred against Diomedon instead of Nearchus.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Valerius Maximus recounts a conspiracy against the tyrant [[Phalaris]], but this would be impossible as Phalaris had died before Zeno was even born.<ref name="books.google.ca"/><ref>[[Valerius Maximus]], ''Memorable Deeds and Sayings.'' Foreign Stories 3. ''ext.'' 2.</ref> According to [[Plutarch]], Zeno attempted to kill the [[List of ancient Greek tyrants#Elea|tyrant Demylus]]. After failing, he had, "with his own teeth bit off his tongue, he spit it in the tyrant’s face."<ref>Plutarch, ''Against Colotes''</ref>

==Works==
Although many ancient writers refer to the writings of Zeno, none of his works survive intact. The main sources on the nature of Zeno's arguments on motion, in fact, come from the writings of [[Aristotle]] and [[Simplicius of Cilicia]].<ref name=Cajori1920>{{cite journal |last1=Cajori |first1=Florian |title=The Purpose of Zeno's Arguments on Motion |journal=Isis |date=1920 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=7–20 |doi=10.1086/357889}}</ref>

Plato says that Zeno's writings were "brought to Athens for the first time on the occasion of" the visit of Zeno and Parmenides.<ref name=parm /> Plato also has Zeno say that this work, "meant to protect the arguments of Parmenides,"<ref name=parm /> was written in Zeno's youth, stolen, and published without his consent. Plato has Socrates paraphrase the "first thesis of the first argument" of Zeno's work as follows: "If being is many, it must be both like and unlike, and this is impossible, for neither can the like be unlike, nor the unlike like."<ref name=parm />

According to [[Proclus]] in his ''Commentary on Plato's Parmenides'', Zeno produced "not less than forty arguments revealing contradictions",<ref>Proclus, ''Commentary on Plato's'' Parmenides, p.&nbsp;29</ref> but only nine are now known.

Zeno's arguments are perhaps the first examples of a method of proof called ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'', literally meaning ''to reduce to the absurd.'' Parmenides is said{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} to be the first individual to implement this style of argument.  This form of argument soon became known as the ''epicheirema'' (ἐπιχείρημα). In Book VII of his ''Topics'', [[Aristotle]] says that an ''epicheirema'' is "a dialectical [[syllogism]]." It is a connected piece of reasoning which an opponent has put forward as true. The disputant sets out to break down the dialectical syllogism. This destructive method of argument was maintained by him to such a degree that [[Seneca the Younger]] commented a few centuries later, "If I accede to Parmenides there is nothing left but the One; if I accede to Zeno, not even the One is left."<ref name=zeno>''Zeno'' in ''The Presocratics'', Philip Wheelwright ed., The Odyssey Press, 1966, pp. 106–107.</ref>

Zeno is also regarded as the first philosopher who dealt with the earliest attestable accounts of mathematical [[infinity]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

According to [[William Smith (lexicographer)|Sir William Smith]], in [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] (1870)<ref name=Smith>{{cite DGRBM |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Pr8_AQAAIAAJ&pg=PA125&dq=cosmogony+of+Parmenides,+which+was+carried+out+very&hl=en&sa=X&ei=8oBpVcvrAa2v7AaezoP4Dg&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=cosmogony%20of%20Parmenides%2C%20which%20was%20carried%20out%20very&f=false |title=Parmenides |year=1870 |page=125}}</ref>
:''Others content themselves with reckoning [[Parmenides]] as well as ''Zeno'' as belonging to the [[Pythagorean school]], or with speaking of a ''Parraenidean life'', in the same way as a ''Pythagorean life'' is spoken of; and even the censorious Timon allows Parmenides to have been a high-minded man; while Plato speaks of him with veneration, and Aristotle and others give him an unqualified preference over the rest of the Eleatics.''

== Zeno's paradoxes ==
{{Main| Zeno's paradoxes}}
Zeno's paradoxes have puzzled, challenged, influenced, inspired, infuriated, and amused philosophers, mathematicians, and physicists for over two millennia. The most famous are the arguments against motion described by Aristotle in his ''Physics''.<ref>Aristotle. [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.html ''Physics''], translated by R.P. Hardie and R.K. Gaye. Internet Classics Archive.</ref>
