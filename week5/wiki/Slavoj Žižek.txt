==Biography==
===Early life===
Žižek was born in [[Ljubljana]], [[SR Slovenia]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], into a middle-class family.<ref name="mladina.si">{{cite web|url=http://www.mladina.si/tednik/200442/clanek/nar-kdo_je_kdaj--ursa_matos/ |trans_title=Who's When: Slavoj Žižek.

His mother Vesna, native of the [[Gorizia Hills]] in the [[Slovenian Littoral]], was an accountant in a state enterprise. His parents were [[Atheism|atheists]].<ref name="mladina.si"/><ref>''Slovenski biografski leksikon'' (Ljubljana: [[Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts|SAZU]], 1991), XV. edition</ref> He spent most of his childhood in the coastal town of [[Portorož]], where he was exposed to Western film, theory and popular culture.<ref name="iep.utm.edu"/><ref name=slovenskapomlad>{{cite web|url=http://www.slovenskapomlad.si/2?id=20 |title=Slovenska pomlad: Slavoj Žižek (Webpage run by the National Museum of Modern History in Ljubljana) |publisher=Slovenskapomlad.si |date=29 September 1988 |accessdate=4 June 2011}}</ref>  When Slavoj was a teenager his family moved back to Ljubljana where he attended [[Bežigrad High School]].<ref name=slovenskapomlad/> In the 1960s and early 1970s, Slavoj was exposed to a lot of western philosophy in [[Zagreb]]. {{Citation needed|reason=cba to source it, goes into this here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqmOkBK7lFA|date=April 2017}}

===Education===
In 1967, during an era of [[liberalization]] of the [[Titoism|Titoist]] Yugoslavia, Žižek enrolled at the [[University of Ljubljana]], and studied philosophy and sociology.<ref name="lacan.com">Tony Meyers [http://www.lacan.com/zizekchro1.htm Slavoj Zizek - His Life] lacan.com, from: Slavoj Zizek, London: Routledge, 2003.</ref>

He had already begun reading French [[Structuralism|structuralists]] prior to entering university, and in 1967, he published the first translation of a text by [[Jacques Derrida]] into Slovenian.<ref name="mladina.si 42">{{cite web|url=http://www.mladina.si/tednik/200442/clanek/nar-kdo_je_kdaj--ursa_matos/ |title=Tednik, številka 42, Slavoj Žižek |publisher=Mladina.Si |date=24 October 2004 |accessdate=13 August 2010}}</ref><ref name="mladina.si 42"/> 
An early influence at university was [[Božidar Debenjak]] who taught the philosophy of [[German idealism]] and introduced the thought of the [[Frankfurt School]] to Slovenia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dpu.mirovni-institut.si/9letnik/debenjak.php |title=Delavsko-punkerska univerza |publisher=Dpu.mirovni-institut.si |date=22 February 1999 |accessdate=13 August 2010}}</ref> His reading of Marx's ''[[Das Kapital]]'' from the perspective of Hegel's ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit|Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' influenced many future Slovenian philosophers, including Žižek.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mladina.si/tednik/200904/dr__bozidar_debenjak__filozof |title=Tednik, številka 04, Dr. Božidar Debenjak, filozof |publisher=Mladina.Si |date=6 February 2009 |accessdate=13 August 2010}}</ref>

Žižek frequented the circles of dissident intellectuals, including the [[Martin Heidegger|Heideggerian]] philosophers [[Tine Hribar]] and [[Ivo Urbančič]],<ref name="mladina.si 42"/> and published articles in alternative magazines, such as ''[[Praxis School|Praxis]]'', ''Tribuna'' and ''Problemi'', which he also edited.<ref name=slovenskapomlad/> In 1971, he accepted a job as an assistant researcher with the promise of tenure, but was dismissed after his Master's thesis was accused of being "non-Marxist."<ref name="p37">Žižek's response to the article "Če sem v kaj resnično zaljubljena, sem v življenje Sobotna priloga Dela, p. 37 (19.1. 2008)</ref> He graduated from the University of Ljubljana in 1981 with a [[Doctor of Arts]] in Philosophy for his dissertation entitled ''The Theoretical and Practical Relevance of French Structuralism''.<ref name="lacan.com"/>

He spent the next few years undertaking [[national service]] in the [[Yugoslav army]] in [[Karlovac]].<ref name="lacan.com"/>

===Career===
During the 1980s, Žižek edited and translated [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and [[Louis Althusser]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dskp-drustvo.si/prevajalci.php |title=Prevajalci&nbsp;– Društvo slovenskih književnih prevajalcev |publisher=Dskp-drustvo.si |accessdate=7 January 2012}}</ref> He used Jacques Lacan's work to interpret [[Hegelianism|Hegelian]] and Marxist philosophy.

In 1985, Žižek completed a second doctorate ([[Doctor of Philosophy]] in [[psychoanalysis]]) at the [[University of Paris VIII]]<ref name="lacan.com"/> under [[Jacques-Alain Miller]] and [[François Regnault]].

He wrote the introduction to Slovene translations of [[G. K. Chesterton]]'s and [[John Le Carré]]'s detective novels.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} 
In 1988, he published his first book dedicated entirely to [[film theory]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} He achieved international recognition as a [[Social theory|social theorist]] with the 1989 publication of his first book in English, ''The Sublime Object of Ideology''.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Žižek has been publishing in journals such as ''[[Lacanian Ink]]'' and ''[[In These Times]]'' in the United States, the ''[[New Left Review]]'' and ''[[The London Review of Books]]'' in the United Kingdom, and with the Slovenian [[Social liberalism|left-liberal]] magazine ''[[Mladina]]'' and newspapers ''[[Dnevnik (Ljubljana)|Dnevnik]]'' and ''[[Delo]]''. He also cooperates with the Polish leftist magazine ''[[Krytyka Polityczna]]'', regional southeast European left-wing journal ''[[Novi Plamen]]'', and serves on the editorial board of the psychoanalytical journal ''Problemi''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Žižek is a series editor of the [[Northwestern University Press]] series Diaeresis that publishes works that "deal not only with philosophy, but also will intervene at the levels of ideology critique, politics, and art theory."<ref>{{cite web|title=Diaeresis series page|url=http://www.nupress.northwestern.edu/content/diaeresis|website=Northwestern University Press|publisher=Northwestern University Press|accessdate=28 January 2017}}</ref>

===Politics===
In the late 1980s, Žižek came to public attention as a columnist for the alternative youth magazine ''[[Mladina]]'', which was critical of Tito's policies, Yugoslav politics, especially the [[militarization]] of society. He was a member of the [[Communist Party of Slovenia]] until October 1988, when he quit in protest against the [[JBTZ trial]] together with 32 other Slovenian intellectuals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slovenskapomlad.si/1?id=103 |title=Skupinski protestni izstop iz ZKS |date=28 October 1998 |publisher=Slovenska Pomlad}}</ref> Between 1988 and 1990, he was actively involved in several political and [[civil society]] movements which fought for the [[democratization]] of Slovenia, most notably the [[Committee for the Defence of Human Rights]].<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.slovenskapomlad.si/1?id=31&aofs=3 |title=Odbor za varstvo človekovih pravic  |date=3 June 1998 |publisher=Slovenska Pomlad}}</ref> In the [[Slovenian presidential election, 1990|first free elections]] in 1990, he ran as the [[Liberal Democracy of Slovenia|Liberal Democratic Party]]'s candidate for Slovenian presidency (an office formally abolished in the [[Constitution of Slovenia|1991 constitution]]).{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Despite his activity in liberal democratic projects, Žižek has remained committed to the communist ideal and has been critical of right-wing circles, such as nationalists, [[Conservatism|conservatives]], and [[Classical liberalism|classical liberals]] both in Slovenia and worldwide. He wrote that the [[Cankar Hall|convention center]] in which nationalist [[Slovene writers]] hold their conventions should be blown up, adding, "Since we live in the time without any sense of irony, I must add I don't mean it literally."<ref name="Interview_part_two">[https://www.webcitation.org/6FZv9WUfX Interview] with Žižek – part two, [[Delo]], 2 March 2013.</ref> Similarly, he jokingly made the following comment in May 2013, during [[Subversive Festival]]: "If they don't support [[SYRIZA]], then, in my vision of the democratic future, all these people will get from me [is] a first-class one-way ticket to [a] [[gulag]]." In response, the right-wing [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] party claimed Žižek's comments should be understood literally, not ironically.<ref name="Mionis interview">{{cite news |title=Israel must fight to keep neo-Nazis out of Greece's government |author=Sabby Mionis |url=http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/israel-must-fight-to-keep-neo-nazis-out-of-greece-s-government-1.416802 |newspaper=Haaretz |date=6 March 2012 |accessdate=6 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_20/05/2013_499789 |title=Slovenian philosopher Zizek proposes 'gulag' for those who do not support SYRIZA |date=20 May 2013 |accessdate=20 May 2013 }}</ref>

In a 2008 interview with [[Amy Goodman]] on ''[[Democracy Now!]]'', he described himself as a "communist in a qualified sense," and in another appearance in October 2009 he described himself as a "radical leftist."<ref name="democracynow.org">[http://www.democracynow.org/2008/3/11/everybody_in_the_world_except_us ''Democracy Now!'' television program online transcript], 11 March 2008.</ref><ref name="http">{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2009/10/15/slovenian_philosopher_slavoj_zizek_on_the |title=Slovenian Philosopher Slavoj Zizek on Capitalism, Healthcare, Latin American "Populism" and the "Farcical" Financial Crisis |publisher=Democracynow.org |accessdate=13 August 2010}}</ref> The following year Žižek appeared in the [[Arte]] documentary ''[[Marx Reloaded]]'' in which he defended the idea of communism.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

In 2013, he corresponded with imprisoned Russian activist and [[Pussy Riot]] member [[Nadezhda Tolokonnikova]].<ref name="Guardian, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova of Pussy Riot's prison letters to Slavoj Žižek">{{cite web|title=Nadezhda Tolokonnikova of Pussy Riot's prison letters to Slavoj Žižek|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/15/pussy-riot-nadezhda-tolokonnikova-slavoj-zizek}}</ref>{{Quote|text=All hearts were beating for you as long as you were perceived as just another version of the liberal-democratic protest against the authoritarian state.

Just before the [[2017 French presidential election]], Žižek stated that one could not choose between [[Emmanuel Macron|Macron]] and [[Marine Le Pen|Le Pen]], arguing that the "[[neoliberalism]]" of Macron just gives rise to [[neo-fascism|neofascism]] anyway. This was in response to many on the left calling for support for Macron to prevent a Le Pen victory.<ref>https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/french-elections-marine-le-pen-emmanuel-macron-no-real-choice-a7714911.html</ref>

===Public life===
[[File:Slavoj Žižek 2011.jpg|alt=|thumb|left|Žižek speaking in 2011]]

In 2003, Žižek wrote text to accompany [[Bruce Weber (photographer)|Bruce Weber]]'s photographs in a catalog for [[Abercrombie & Fitch]]. Questioned as to the seemliness of a major intellectual writing ad copy, Žižek told ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', "If I were asked to choose between doing things like this to earn money and becoming fully employed as an American academic, kissing ass to get a tenured post, I would with pleasure choose writing for such journals!"<ref>Glenn, Joshua. "The Examined Life: Enjoy Your Chinos!", ''[[The Boston Globe]]''. 6 July 2003. H2.</ref>

Žižek and his thought have been the subject of several documentaries. The 1996 ''[[Liebe Dein Symptom wie Dich selbst!]]'' is a German documentary on him. In the 2004 ''[[The Reality of the Virtual]]'', Žižek gave a one-hour lecture on his interpretation of Lacan's tripartite thesis of the imaginary, the symbolic, and the real.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} ''[[Zizek!]]'' is a 2005 documentary by [[Astra Taylor]] on his philosophy. The 2006 ''[[The Pervert's Guide to Cinema]]''  and 2012 ''[[The Pervert's Guide to Ideology]]''  also portray Žižek's ideas and cultural criticism. ''[[Examined Life]]'' (2008) features Žižek speaking about aesthetics at a garbage dump. He was also featured in the 2011 ''[[Marx Reloaded]]'', directed by [[Jason Barker]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

''[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]'' named Žižek one of its 2012 [[FP Top 100 Global Thinkers|Top 100 Global Thinkers]] "for giving voice to an era of absurdity."<ref name="The FP Top 100 Global Thinkers"/>

In January 2013, the British [[Royal Opera House]] announced  that four new operas inspired by Žižek's writings have been commissioned.<ref name="RoyalOperaHouse"/>

===Personal life===
Žižek has been married three times: first, to [[Renata Salecl]],<ref name="Interview_with_Salecl_2010">{{cite web|url=http://www.mladina.si/51268/dr__renata_salecl__filozofinja_in_sociologinja/ |title=Interview with Renata Salecl |publisher=Mladina |date=29 July 2010 |accessdate=4 December 2012}}</ref> another [[Slovene philosophy|Slovene philosopher]]; second, to fashion model Analia Hounie, daughter of an Argentine Lacanian psychoanalyst; and third, to the Slovene journalist [[Jela Krečič]], daughter of the historian of architecture [[Peter Krečič]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.delo.si/druzba/panorama/zizka-vzela-jela-z-dela.html |title=Žižka vzela Jela z Dela |publisher=Delo |date=1 July 2013 |accessdate=3 July 2013}}</ref><ref name="Delo_2005">{{cite web|url=http://www.delo.si/clanek/8516 |title=Philosopher and Beauty |publisher=Delo |date=29 March 2005 |accessdate=4 December 2012}}</ref>

===Impact===

His [[Slavoj Žižek bibliography|body of writing]] spans dense theoretical polemics, academic tomes, and accessible introductory books; in addition, he has taken part in various film projects, including two documentary collaborations with director [[Sophie Fiennes]], ''[[The Pervert's Guide to Cinema]]'' (2006) and ''[[The Pervert's Guide to Ideology]]'' (2012).

Hundreds of academics have addressed aspects of Žižek's work in professional papers,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?num=50&hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&q=slavoj+zizek&btnG=Search |title=Google Scholar search for Zizek |publisher=Google Scholar |accessdate=4 June 2011}}</ref> and in 2007, the ''[[International Journal of Žižek Studies]]'' was established for the discussion of his work.

===Ontology, ideology, and the Real===
Žižek argues that:<ref>Žižek, Slavoj. The Sublime Object of Ideology. New York: Verso, 1989.</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = Less Than Nothing: Hegel and the Shadow of Dialectical Materialism|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XxYQCoaEU7AC|publisher = Verso Books|date = 2012-05-22|isbn = 9781844678976|first = Slavoj|last = Žižek}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = Absolute Recoil: Towards A New Foundation Of Dialectical Materialism|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=i8xNBAAAQBAJ|publisher = Verso Books|date = 2014-10-07|isbn = 9781781686836|first = Slavoj|last = Zizek}}</ref>

# (Against [[Karl Marx|Marx]]'s concept of ideology as described in ''[[The German Ideology]]''), [[False consciousness]] prevents people from seeing how things really are. (Building upon Althusser), Ideology is thoroughly unconscious and functions as a series of justifications and [[spontaneous order|spontaneous]] socio-symbolic rituals which support virtual authorities.
# [[The Real]] is not experienced as something which is ordered in a way that give satisfactory meaning to all its parts in relation to one another. Instead the Real is experienced as through the lens of hegemonic systems of representation and reproduction, whilst resisting full inscription into ordering system ascribed to it. This in turn may lead subjects to experience the Real as generating political resistance.

(Drawing on Lacan's notion of the barred subject), The [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] is a purely negative [[entity]], a void of negativity (in the Hegelian sense), which allows for the flexibility and reflexivity of the cartesian [[cogito ergo sum|Cogito]] (Transcendental Subject).<ref name="Britannica"/><ref name=Sinnerbrink2008>{{cite journal|last=Sinnerbrink|first=Robert|title=The Hegelian 'Night of the World': Žižek on Subjectivity, Negativity, and Universality|journal=International Journal of Žižek Studies|year=2008|volume=2|issue=2|url=http://zizekstudies.org/index.php/ijzs/article/view/136|accessdate=17 August 2012|issn=1751-8229|quote=This extraordinary analysis of the transcendental imagination, critique of Heidegger, and rereading of Hegelian 'night of the world,' together contribute to a reassertion of the radicality of the 'Cartesian subject'—that thoroughly repudiated theoretical spectre which nonetheless continues to 'haunt Western academia' (1999: 1–5). This unorthodox reading of the Hegelian 'night of the world'—the radical negativity that haunts subjectivity—is developed further in an explicitly political direction, which helps explain a critique of the 'Fukuyamaian' consensus, shared both by moral-religious conservatives and libertarian 'postmodernists', that global capitalism remains the 'unsurpassable horizon of our times'.}}</ref> Though consciousness is opaque (following Hegel), the epistemological gap between the In-itself and For-itself is immanent to reality itself;.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Umbr(a): The Object|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=k7QbBAAAQBAJ|publisher = Umbr(a) Journal|date = 2013-01-01|isbn = 9780979953965|first = Tom|last = Eyers|first2 = Graham|last2 = Harman|first3 = Adrian|last3 = Johnston|first4 = Guy Le|last4 = Gaufey|first5 = Todd|last5 = McGowan|first6 = Duane|last6 = Rousselle|first7 = Jelica Šumič|last7 = Riha|first8 = Rado|last8 = Riha}}</ref> The [[Kant's antinomies|antinomies]] of Kant, quantum physics, and Badiou's 'materialist' principle that 'The One is Not', point towards an inconsistent ("Barred") Real itself (that Lacan conceptualized prior).<sup>[opaque language]</sup><ref>{{Cite book|title = Less Than Nothing: Hegel and the Shadow of Dialectical Materialism|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FAqM5rxWWKwC|publisher = Verso Books|date = 2012-05-22|isbn = 9781844679027|first = Slavoj|last = Zizek}}</ref>

Although there are multiple Symbolic interpretations of the Real, they are not all relatively "true". Two instances of the Real can be identified: the abject Real (or "real Real"), which cannot be wholly integrated into the symbolic order, and the symbolic Real, a set of signifiers that can never be properly integrated into the horizon of sense of a subject. The truth is revealed in the process of transiting the contradictions; or the real is a "minimal difference", the gap between the infinite judgement of a [[reductionism|reductionist]] materialism and experience as lived,<ref>Zizek, On Belief</ref> the "Parallax" of dialectical antagonisms are inherent to reality itself, and [[Dialectical Materialism]] (contra [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]]) is a new materialist Hegelianism, incorporating the insights of Lacanian psychoanalysis, set theory, quantum physics, and contemporary continental philosophy.

===Political thought and the postmodern subject===

Žižek argues that:

The state is a system of regulatory institutions that shape our behavior. Its power is purely symbolic and has no normative force outside of collective behavior. In this way, the term ''the law'' signifies society's basic principles, which enable interaction by prohibiting certain acts.<ref>Žižek, ''For They Know Not What They Do''</ref>

Political decisions have become depoliticized and accepted as natural conclusions. For example, controversial policy decisions (such as reductions in social welfare spending) are presented as apparently "objective" necessities. Although governments make claims about increased citizen participation and democracy, the important decisions are still made in the interests of [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. The [[two-party system]] dominant in the United States and elsewhere produces a similar illusion.<ref>''A Plea for Intolerance''</ref> It is still necessary to engage in [[Political particularism|particular]] conflicts – such as labor disputes – but the trick is to relate these individual events to the larger struggle. Particular demands, if executed well, might serve as ''metaphorical condensation'' for the system and its injustices. The real political conflict is between an ordered structure of society and those without a place in it.<ref name="Ticklish Subject&nbsp;— Politics">{{cite book|last=Žižek|first=Slavoj|title=The Ticklish Subject: the absent centre of political ontology|year=1999|publisher=Verso|location=London|isbn=9781859848944|chapter=Political Subjectivization and Its Vicissitudes}}</ref>

(In stark contrast to the intellectual tenets of the European "universalist Left" in general, and those [[Jürgen Habermas]] defined as postnational in particular), Pro-sovereignty and pro-independence processes opened in Europe are good.<ref>[https://www.dropbox.com/s/cihuwrieedr8s1j/44101916-LAPIKO-TXOSTENAK-ZIZEK.pdf Žižek: "The force of universalism is in you Basques, not in the Spanish state", Interview in ''ARGIA'' (27 June 2010)]</ref>

The [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] subject is cynical toward official institutions, yet at the same time believes in conspiracies. When we lost our shared belief in a single power, we constructed another of the [[Big Other|Other]] in order to escape the unbearable freedom that we faced.<ref>Žižek, ''Looking Awry: an Introduction to Jacques Lacan through Popular Culture''</ref> It is not enough to merely know that you are being lied to, particularly when continuing to live a normal life under capitalism. For example, that despite people being aware of ideology, they may continue to act as automata (for example continuing to read and edit Wikipedia despite [[WP:BIAS|Wikipedia bias]], improving its reputation in the process), mistakenly believing that they are thereby expressing their radical freedom. Although one may possess a self-awareness, just because one understands what one is doing ''does not mean that one is doing the right thing''.<ref name=YouMay1999>{{cite journal|last=Žižek|first=Slavoj|title=You May!|journal=London Review of Books|date=18 March 1999|volume=21|issue=6|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v21/n06/slavoj-zizek/you-may|accessdate=20 August 2012|quote=But the notion is undermined by the rise of what might be called 'Post-Modern racism', the surprising characteristic of which is its insensitivity to reflection&nbsp;– a neo-Nazi skinhead who beats up black people knows what he's doing, but does it anyway.

Religion is not an enemy but rather one of the fields of struggle. [[Atheism]] is good. Religious fundamentalists are, in a way, no different from "godless Stalinist Communists." They both value divine will and salvation over moral or ethical action.<ref>Žižek, Slavoj. [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/13/opinion/13iht-edzizek.html "Atheism is a legacy worth fighting for"].

==Criticism==
There are two main themes of critique of Žižek's ideas: his failure to articulate an alternative or program in the face of his denunciation of contemporary social, political, and economic arrangements, and his lack of rigor in argumentation.<ref name="ViolentVisions"/>

===Ambiguity and unclear alternatives===
Žižek's philosophical and political positions are not always clear, and his work has been criticized for a failure to take a consistent stance.<ref>Kuhn, Gabriel (2011). [http://www.alpineanarchist.org/r_anarchist_hypothesis.html The Anarchist Hypothesis, or Badiou, Žižek, and the Anti-Anarchist Prejudice] Alpine Anarchist. Retrieved 4 September 2013.</ref> While he has claimed to stand by a revolutionary Marxist project,  his lack of vision concerning the possible circumstances which could lead to successful revolution makes it unclear what that project consists of. According to John Gray and John Holbo, his theoretical argument often lacks grounding in historical fact, which makes him more provocative than insightful.<ref name="ViolentVisions">{{cite journal|last=Gray|first=John|title=The Violent Visions of Slavoj Žižek|journal=New York Review of Books|date=12 July 2012|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/jul/12/violent-visions-slavoj-zizek/|accessdate=22 September 2012}}</ref><ref name=Holbo-2004>{{cite journal|last=Holbo|first=John|title=On Žižek and Trilling|journal=Philosophy and Literature|date=1 January 2004|volume=28|issue=2|pages=430–440|doi=10.1353/phl.2004.0029|quote=...an unhealthy anti-liberal is one, like Z+iz=ek, who ticks and tocks in unreflective revulsion at liberalism, pantomiming that he is de Maistre (or Abraham) or Robespierre (or Lenin) by turns, lest he look like Mill.}}</ref><ref name=Holbo-CT-2010>{{cite news|last=Holbo|first=John|title=Zizek on the Financial Collapse&nbsp;– and Liberalism|url=http://crookedtimber.org/2010/12/17/zizek-on-the-financial-collapse-and-liberalism/|accessdate=21 August 2012|newspaper=Crooked Timbers|date=17 December 2010|quote=To review: Zizek does this liberal = neoliberal thing. Which is no good. And he doesn't even have much to say about economics. And Zizek does this liberal = self-hating pc white intellectuals thing. Which is no good.}}</ref>

[[Roger Scruton]] has written in "Fools, Frauds and Firebrands: Thinkers of the New Left", "To summarize Žižek's position is not easy: he slips between philosophical and psychoanalytical ways of arguing, and is spell-bound by [[Lacan]]'s gnomic utterances. He is a lover of paradox, and believes strongly in what [[Hegel]] called 'the labour of the negative' though taking the idea, as always, one stage further towards the brick wall of paradox".<ref>{{cite book |last=Scruton |first=Roger |date=2015 |title=Fools, Frauds and Firebrands: Thinkers of the New Left |publisher=Bloomsbury |page=256 |isbn=1408187337}}</ref>

Žižek's refusal to present an alternative vision has led critics to accuse him of using unsustainable Marxist categories of analysis and having a 19th-century understanding of class.<ref>Slavoj Zizek responds to his critics, Jacobin, July 3, 2012: https://www.jacobinmag.com/2012/07/slavoj-zizek-responds-to-his-critics/</ref> For example, [[Ernesto Laclau]] argued that "Žižek uses class as a sort of ''deus ex machina'' to play the role of the good guy against the multicultural devils."<ref>Butler, Judith, Ernesto Laclau and Slavoj Žižek ''Contingency, Hegemony, Universality: Contemporary Dialogues on the Left''. Verso. London, New York City 2000. pp. 202–206</ref> The use of such analysis, however, is not systematic and draws on critical accounts of [[Stalinism]] and [[Maoism]], as well as [[post-structuralism]] and Lacanian [[psychoanalysis]].<ref name=VanAuken&Haig-2010>{{cite news|title=Zizek in Manhattan: An intellectual charlatan masquerading as "left"|url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2010/nov2010/zize-n12.shtml|accessdate=21 August 2012|newspaper=World Socialist Web Site|date=12 November 2010|author=Bill Van Auken|author2=Adam Haig}}</ref>

Žižek does not agree with critics who claim he believes in a historical necessity:
<blockquote>There is no such thing as the Communist [[big Other]], there's no historical necessity or [[teleology]] directing and guiding our actions. (In [[Slovene language|Slovene]]: "''Ni komunističnega velikega Drugega, nobene zgodovinske nujnosti ali teleologije, ki bi usmerjala in vodila naša dejanja''".)<ref name="Interview_part_two"/></blockquote>

In his book ''Living in the End Times'', Žižek suggests that the criticism of his positions is itself ambiguous and multilateral: <blockquote>[...] I am attacked for being anti-Semitic ''and'' for spreading [[Zionism|Zionist]] lies, for being a covert Slovene nationalist ''and'' unpatriotic traitor to my nation, for being a crypto-Stalinist defending terror ''and'' for spreading Bourgeois lies about Communism... so maybe, just maybe I am on right path, the path of fidelity to freedom."<ref>Slavoj Žižek. "Living in the End Times".</ref></blockquote>

===Unorthodox style and scholarship===
Critics complain of a theoretical chaos in which questions and answers are confused and in which Žižek constantly recycles old ideas which were scientifically refuted long ago or which in reality have quite a different meaning than Žižek gives to them.<ref>See e.g. David Bordwell, "Slavoj Žižek: Say Anything", DavidBordwell.net blog, April 2005.[http://www.davidbordwell.net/essays/zizek.php]; Philipp Oehmke, "Welcome to the Slavoj Zizek Show". ''Der Spiegel Online (International edition)'', 7 August 2010 [http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/the-most-dangerous-philosopher-in-the-west-welcome-to-the-slavoj-zizek-show-a-705164.html]; [[Jonathan Rée]], "Less Than Nothing by Slavoj Žižek&nbsp;– review. A march through Slavoj Žižek's 'masterwork'". ''The Guardian'', 27 June 2012.[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/27/less-than-nothing-slavoj-zizek-review]</ref> Harpham calls Žižek's style "a stream of nonconsecutive units arranged in arbitrary sequences that solicit a sporadic and discontinuous attention."<ref>Harpham [http://www.uchicago.edu/research/jnl-crit-inq/issues/v29/v29n3.harpham1.html "Doing the Impossible: Slavoj Žižek and the End of Knowledge"]</ref> O'Neill concurs: "a dizzying array of wildly entertaining and often quite maddening rhetorical strategies are deployed in order to beguile, browbeat, dumbfound, dazzle, confuse, mislead, overwhelm, and generally subdue the reader into acceptance."<ref>O'Neill, [http://www.film-philosophy.com/vol5-2001/n17oneill "The Last Analysis of Slavoj Žižek"]</ref>

Such presentation has laid him open to accusations of misreading other philosophers, particularly [[Jacques Lacan]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]. Žižek carries over many concepts from Lacan's teachings into the sphere of political and social theory, but has a tendency to do so in an extreme deviation from its psychoanalytic context.<ref>Ian Parker, ''Slavoj Žižek: A Critical Introduction'' (Pluto Press: London and Sterling, 2004) p.78-80. For example, Žižek's appropriation of Lacan's discussion of [[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]] in his 1959/1960 seminar, ''The Ethics of Psychoanalysis''. In this seminar, Lacan uses Antigone to defend the claim that "the only thing of which one can be guilty is of having given ground relative to one's desire" (Slavoj Žižek, ''The Metastases of Enjoyment'', Verso: London, 1994; p.&nbsp;69). However, as Parker notes, Antigone's act (burying her dead brother in the knowledge that she will be buried alive) was never intended to effect a revolutionary change in the political status quo; yet, despite this, Žižek frequently cites Antigone as a paradigm of ethico-political action.</ref> Similarly, according to some critics, Žižek's conflation of Lacan's unconscious with Hegel's unconscious is mistaken. Noah Horwitz, in an effort to dissociate Lacan from Hegel, interprets the Lacanian unconscious and the Hegelian unconscious as two totally different mechanisms. Horwitz points out, in Lacan and Hegel's differing approaches to the topic of speech, that Lacan's unconscious reveals itself to us in [[parapraxis]], or "slips-of-the-tongue". We are therefore, according to Lacan, alienated from language through the revelation of our desire (even if that desire originated with the Other, as he claims, it remains peculiar to us). In Hegel's unconscious, however, we are alienated from language whenever we attempt to articulate a particular and end up articulating a universal. For example, if I say 'the dog is with me', although I am trying to say something about this particular dog at this particular time, I actually produce the universal category 'dog', and therefore express a generality, not the particularity I desire. Hegel's argument implies that, at the level of sense-certainty, we can never express the true nature of reality. Lacan's argument implies, to the contrary, that speech reveals the true structure of a particular unconscious mind.<ref>Noah Horwitz, "Contra the Slovenians: Returning to Lacan and away from Hegel" (''Philosophy Today'', Spring 2005, pp.&nbsp;24–32.</ref>

In a very negative review of Žižek's magnum opus ''Less than Nothing'', the British political philosopher [[John Gray (philosopher)|John Gray]] attacked Žižek for his celebrations of violence, his failure to ground his theories in historical facts, and his ‘formless radicalism’ which, according to Gray, professes to be communist yet lacks the conviction that communism could ever be successfully realized. Gray concluded that Žižek's work, though entertaining, is intellectually worthless: 'Achieving a deceptive substance by endlessly reiterating an essentially empty vision, Žižek's work amounts in the end to less than nothing.'<ref name="ViolentVisions"/>

===Accusations of self-plagiarism in 2014===
Žižek's tendency to recycle portions of his own texts in subsequent works resulted in the accusation of [[self-plagiarism]] by ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2014, after Žižek published 
an op-ed in the magazine which contained portions of his writing from an earlier book.<ref name="Newsweek">{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/slavoj-zizek-self-plagiarized-new-york-times-269221|title=Slavoj Žižek On 'Self Plagiarism' in The New York Times: What's the Big Deal?|date=10 September 2014|publisher=}}</ref> In response, Žižek expressed perplexity at the harsh tone of the denunciation, emphasizing that the recycled passages in question only acted as references from his theoretical books to supplement otherwise original writing.<ref name="Newsweek"/>

On 11 July 2014, American weekly newsmagazine ''[[Newsweek]]'' reported that in an article published in 2006 Žižek plagiarized substantial passages from an earlier review that first appeared in the journal ''[[American Renaissance (magazine)|American Renaissance]]'', a publication condemned by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] as the organ of a "white nationalist hate group."<ref name="American_Renaissance_Plagiarism">{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/did-marxist-philosophy-superstar-slavoj-zizek-plagiarize-white-nationalist-journal-258433 |title= Did Marxist Philosophy Superstar Slavoj Žižek Plagiarize a White Nationalist Journal?|work= Newsweek |date=11 July 2014 |accessdate=13 July 2014}}</ref> However, in response to the allegations, Žižek stated:
<blockquote>When I was writing the text on Derrida which contains the problematic passages, a friend told me about [[Kevin B. MacDonald|Kevin Macdonald's]]  theories, and I asked him to send me a brief resume. The friend send [sic] it to me, assuring me that I can use it freely since it merely resumes another's line of thought. Consequently, I did just that – and I sincerely apologize for not knowing that my friend's resume was largely borrowed from Stanley Hornbeck's review of Macdonald's book. [...] As any reader can quickly establish, the problematic passages are purely informative, a report on another's theory for which I have no affinity whatsoever; all I do after this brief resume is quickly dismissing Macdonald's theory as a new chapter in the long process of the destruction of Reason. In no way can I thus be accused of plagiarizing another's line of thought, of "stealing ideas". I nonetheless deeply regret the incident.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dean|first1=Michelle|title=Slavoj Žižek Sorta Kinda Admits Plagiarizing White Supremacist Journal|url=http://gawker.com/slavoj-zizek-sorta-kinda-admits-plagiarizing-white-supr-1604590014|website=Gawker.com|publisher=Gawker Online|accessdate=20 February 2015}}</ref></blockquote>
