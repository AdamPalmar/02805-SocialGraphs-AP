'''Raghunatha Shiromani''' ({{lang-bn|রঘুনাথ শিরোমণি}}, [[IAST]]: Raghunātha Śiromaṇi) (c. 1477–1547<ref name="Vidyabhushan">{{cite book|last=Vidyabhusana|first=Satis Chandra|title=A History of Indian Logic: Ancient, Mediaeval, and Modern Schools|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|location=Delhi|origyear=1920|year=2006|page=463|isbn=81-208-0565-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0lG85RD9YZoC&pg=PA463&dq=Raghunatha+Shiromani&lr=&ei=ak5-S5yzFJPkkwTZ742XCg&cd=3#v=onepage&q=&f=false}}</ref>) was an [[India]]n [[Indian philosophy|philosopher]] and [[Indian logic|logician]]. He was born at [[Nabadwip]] in present-day [[Nadia district]] of [[West Bengal]] state. He was the grandson of {{IAST|Śulapāṇi}} (c. 14th century CE), a noted writer on {{IAST|[[Smṛti]]}} from his mother's side. He was a pupil of {{IAST|Vāsudeva Sārvabhauma}}. He brought the new school of [[Nyaya]], ''{{IAST|Navya Nyāya}}'', representing the final development of Indian [[formal logic]], to its zenith of analytic power.

Raghunatha's analysis of relations revealed the true nature of number, inseparable from the abstraction of natural phenomena, and his studies of [[metaphysics]] dealt with the [[negation]] or [[nonexistence]] of a complex [[reality]]. His most famous work in logic was the [[Tattvachintamanididhiti|{{IAST |Tattvacintāmaṇidīdhiti}}]], a commentary on the ''[[Tattvacintāmaṇi]]'' of [[Gangesha|{{IAST |Gangeśa Upādhyāya}}]], founder of the ''{{IAST |Navya Nyāya}}'' school.

A descriptive information of Raghunatha with some controversial issues (his connection with Mahaprabhu Shri [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Chaitanya]]) and bibliography are to be found at

The contemporary deployment of a new category, svatva ( endowment, possessed-ness, entitlement, my-ness), introduced by Raghunatha, is discussed in [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2054667 Language: From I-dentity to My-dentity]
