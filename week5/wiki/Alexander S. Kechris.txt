'''Alexander''' ('''Alekos''') '''Sotirios Kechris''' ({{lang-el|Αλέξανδρος (Αλέκος) Σωτήριος Κεχρής}}; born March 23, 1946) is a [[Set theory|set]] theorist and [[Mathematical logic|logician]] at [[California Institute of Technology]]. 

He has made major contributions to the theory of [[Borel equivalence relation]]s and the theory of automorphism groups of uncountable structures. His research interests cover foundations of mathematics, mathematical logic and set theory and their interactions with analysis and dynamical systems. 

Kechris earned his [[Ph.D.]] in 1972 under the direction of [[Yiannis N. Moschovakis]], with a dissertation titled ''[[Projective set|Projective]] [[Ordinal number|Ordinals]] and [[Countable]] [[Analytic set|Analytic Sets]]''. During his academic career he advised 23 PhD and sponsored 20 postdoc students.

In 2012 he became an Inaugural Fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].<ref>[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2013-01-27.</ref>
