{{Distinguish2|the French diplomat and scholar [[Jean Nicot]]}}

'''Jean George Pierre Nicod''' (1893, France &ndash; 16 February 1924, [[Geneva]], Switzerland) was a French [[philosopher]], [[mathematician]] and [[logician]].

==Biography==
In his best known work, he showed that the classical [[propositional calculus]] could be derived from one axiom and one rule, both expressed using the [[Sheffer stroke]]. He also proposed the [[Nicod's axiom]] and developed [[Nicod's criterion]].

Nicod died at the age of 31 from [[tuberculosis]].

== Legacy ==
The [[Institut Jean Nicod]] (Paris) &mdash; a branch of the French ''Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique'' ([[CNRS]]) -- is research laboratory at the interface between  [[cognitive science]] and the [[social science]]s &mdash; was named in honour of Nicod's memory. Jean Nicod's name is also commemorated by the prestigious [[Jean Nicod Prize|Jean Nicod Lectures]], delivered annually in Paris by a leading [[philosopher of mind]] or philosophically oriented [[cognitive scientist]], and published as a series by the [[MIT Press]]. The lecturer is awarded the [[Jean Nicod Prize]] by the [[CNRS]].
