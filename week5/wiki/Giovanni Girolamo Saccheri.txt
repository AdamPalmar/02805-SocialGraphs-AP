'''Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri''' ({{IPA-it|dʒoˈvanni dʒiˈrɔlamo sakˈkɛri}}; 5 September 1667 – 25 October 1733) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Jesuit]] priest, [[scholastic philosopher]], and [[mathematician]].
{{jesuit}}
Saccheri was born in [[Sanremo]]. He entered the Jesuit order in 1685 and was ordained as a priest in 1694. He taught philosophy at the [[University of Turin]] from 1694 to 1697 and philosophy, theology and mathematics at the [[University of Pavia]] from 1697 until his death. He was a protégé of the mathematician [[Tommaso Ceva]] and published several works including ''Quaesita geometrica'' (1693), ''Logica demonstrativa'' (1697), and ''Neo-statica'' (1708).

==Geometrical work==
He is primarily known today for his last publication, in 1733 shortly before his death. Now considered the second work in [[non-Euclidean geometry]], ''Euclides ab omni naevo vindicatus'' (''Euclid Freed of Every Flaw'') languished in obscurity until it was rediscovered by [[Eugenio Beltrami]], in the mid-19th century.

Many of Saccheri's ideas have a precedent in the 11th-century Persian polymath [[Omar Khayyám]]'s ''Discussion of Difficulties in Euclid'' (''Risâla fî sharh mâ ashkala min musâdarât Kitâb 'Uglîdis''), a fact ignored in most Western sources until recently.

It is unclear whether Saccheri had access to that work in translation or he developed his ideas independently. The [[Saccheri quadrilateral]] is now sometimes referred to as the Khayyam-Saccheri quadrilateral.

The intent of Saccheri's work was ostensibly to establish the validity of Euclid by means of a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' proof of any alternative to [[Euclid]]'s [[parallel postulate]].  To do so, he assumed that the parallel postulate was false and attempted to derive a contradiction.

Since Euclid's postulate is equivalent to the statement that the sum of the internal angles of a triangle is 180°, he considered both the hypothesis that the angles add up to more or less than 180°.

The first led to the conclusion that straight lines are finite, contradicting Euclid's second postulate. So Saccheri correctly rejected it. However, the principle is now accepted as the basis of [[elliptic geometry]], where both the second and fifth postulates are rejected.

The second possibility turned out to be harder to refute. In fact he was unable to derive a logical contradiction and instead derived many non-intuitive results; for example that triangles have a maximum finite area and that there is an absolute unit of length. He finally concluded that: "the hypothesis of the acute angle is absolutely false; because it is repugnant to the nature of straight lines". Today, his results are theorems of [[hyperbolic geometry]].

There is some minor argument on whether Saccheri really meant that, as he published his work in the final year of his life, came extremely close to discovering non-Euclidean geometry and was a logician. Some believe Saccheri concluded as he did only to avoid the criticism that might come from seemingly-illogical aspects of hyperbolic geometry.
