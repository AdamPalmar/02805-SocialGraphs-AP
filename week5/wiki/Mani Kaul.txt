'''Mani Kaul''' (25 December 1944 – 6 July 2011) was arguably the greatest Indian director of [[Hindi film]]s and an influential figure in Indian [[parallel cinema]].<ref name=guard/> He graduated from the [[Film and Television Institute of India]] (FTII) where he was a student of [[Ritwik Ghatak]] and later became a teacher. Starting his career with ''[[Uski Roti]]'' (1969), which won him the [[Filmfare Critics Award for Best Movie]], he went on to win four of them in all. He won the [[National Film Award for Best Direction]] in 1974 for ''[[Duvidha]]'' and later the National Film Award for his documentary film, ''[[Siddheshwari]]'' in 1989.<ref name=cnn>{{cite news |title=Noted filmmaker Mani Kaul dead |url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/noted-filmmaker-mani-kaul-dead/165336-8-66.html |publisher=[[CNN-IBN]] |date=6 Jul 2011}}</ref>

==Early life and background==
Born Rabindranath Kaul, in [[Jodhpur]], Rajasthan, in a [[Kashmiri Pandit]] family,<ref name=guard>{{cite web| title = Mani Kaul obituary|publisher= The Guardian|author=Derek Malcolm|authorlink=Derek Malcolm|date=14 July 2011|url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jul/14/mani-kaul-obituary| accessdate = 2013-10-08}}</ref><ref name=jag>{{cite web| title = Filmmaker Mani Kaul passes away after prolonged illness| url = http://post.jagran.com/filmmaker-mani-kaul-passes-away-after-prolonged-illness-1309944386|publisher=[[Dainik Jagran]], Jagran Post|date=6 Jul 2011| accessdate = 2013-10-08}}</ref> Kaul first joined FTII, Pune as an acting student and later shifted to the direction course, where noted film director Ritwik Ghatak was a teacher, graduating in 1966.<ref name=upst>{{cite web |title=Profile |url=http://www.upperstall.com/people/mani-kaul |publisher=[[upperstall.com]]}}</ref>{{dubious|date=January 2012}}

He was the nephew of actor-director Mahesh Kaul, who made films like [[Raj Kapoor]] starrer ''[[Sapnon Ka Saudagar]]'' (1968).<ref name=upst/>

==Career==
His first film ''[[Uski Roti]]'' (1969) has been described as "one of the key films of the New Indian Cinema or the Indian New Wave".<ref name=upst>{{cite web |title=Profile |url=http://www.upperstall.com/people/mani-kaul |publisher=[[upperstall.com]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title = ‘Mani Kaul’s films didn’t come to you, you had to go to them’|publisher=Indian Express| url = http://www.indianexpress.com/news/-Mani-Kaul-s-films-didn-t-come-to-you--you-had-to-go-to-them-/817832/|date=Jul 16, 2011| accessdate = 2013-10-08}}</ref> It marked a drastic departure from earlier Indian cinema technique, form and narrative. It was one of the early formal experimental films in Indian cinema.

''[[Ashadh Ka Ek Din]]'' (1971), his next film, was based on a play by [[Mohan Rakesh]].

''[[Duvidha]]'', his third film, was his first in colour. It grew out of a short story by [[Vijaydan Detha]] and tells the story of a merchant's son, who returns with his new bride. When he departs on a business trip, a ghost falls in love with the wife. It was widely shown across Europe. He was awarded the prestigious [[Jawaharlal Nehru Fellowship]] in 1974.<ref>{{cite web| title = Official list of Jawaharlal Nehru Fellows (1969-present)|work = [[Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fund]] | url = http://www.jnmf.in/flist.html  }}</ref>
 
Kaul was one of the co-founders of the Yukt Film Co-operative (Union of Kinematograph Technicians) in 1976, leading to avant-garde films. Critics<ref name=upst/> opined in "Mani Kaul's cinematic conception, fiction and documentary films have no clear demarcated dividing line." He also taught music in the Netherlands, and was Creative Director of the film house at Osian's Connoisseurs of Art, Mumbai.

In 1971, he was a member of the jury at the [[21st Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name="berlinale 1971">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1971/04_jury_1971/04_Jury_1971.html |title=Berlinale 1971: Juries |accessdate=13 March 2010 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref>

He was a visiting lecturer at [[Harvard University]] for the 2000–2001 school year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=103655|title=The Harvard Crimson:: Indie Film Director to Teach VES Course}}</ref>

==Tribute==
According to a tribute<ref name="Docuwallahs - 06Jul2011 - Mani Kaul no more">{{cite news|url=http://movies.groups.yahoo.com/group/docuwallahs2/message/9878|title=Mani Kaul no more|date=6 July 2011|work=[[Docuwallahs2]]|accessdate=6 July 2011}}</ref> from Prabha Mahajan on the Indian documentary film discussion network Docuwallahs2 [https://groups.yahoo.com/group/docuwallahs2], Mani Kaul's significant body of work included both feature films and documentaries. In an interview Mani stated: "The dividing line from my films and documentaries is thin. Some of my films like ''[[Siddheshwari]]'' are like poetic documentaries." Mani Kaul's fellow alumni from [[Film and Television Institute of India|FTII]] intend to put together a collective tribute to Mani Kaul and his work, and interested persons were invited to send in their thoughts on Mani as a film maker, teacher/ mentor, colleague, and as a person.

Indian film critic [[Khalid Mohamed]] commented,<ref name="Deccan Chronicle - 07Jul2011 - Mani Kaul no more">{{cite news|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/editorial/dc-comment/determined-outsider-183|title=The determined outsider|date=7 July 2011|work=Deccan Chronicle |location=India|accessdate=6 July 2011}}</ref> "As a film director, he discussed the status of women (''[[Uski Roti]]'', ''[[Duvidha]]''), crafted visually seductive documentaries (''Arrival'', ''Before My Eyes'', ''A Desert of a Thousand Lines'') and went through a spell of interpreting [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]’s masterworks. The Russian writer’s short story ''A Gentle Creature'' inspired ''[[Nazar (1991 film)|Nazar]]'', shot in low, chiaroscuro lighting."
