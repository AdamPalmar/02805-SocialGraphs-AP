==Political activity==
George twice served as Governor of the West Virginia Democratic Youth Conference, and attended the [[1976 Democratic National Convention]] as an alternate delegate. George moved to the right in the 1980s, largely due to his views on [[abortion]],<ref name=nytimes /> and left the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] as a result of what he saw as its increasingly strong commitment to legal abortion and its public funding, and his growing skepticism about the effectiveness of [[Great Society]] social welfare projects in Appalachia and other low income rural and urban areas.  George founded the [[American Principles Project]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://americanprinciplesproject.org/ |title=American Principles Project |publisher=Americanprinciplesproject.org |date= |accessdate=2015-06-27}}</ref> which aims to create a grass-roots movement around his ideas.<ref name=nytimes /> He is a past chairman of the [[National Organization for Marriage]], an advocacy group opposed to [[same-sex marriage]],<ref name=nytimes /> and co-founder of the Renewal Forum, an organization fighting the sexual trafficking and commercial exploitation of women and children.

George drafted the ''[[Manhattan Declaration: A Call of Christian Conscience|Manhattan Declaration]]'', a manifesto signed by Orthodox, Catholic and Evangelical leaders that "promised resistance to the point of civil disobedience against any legislation that might implicate their churches or charities in abortion, embryo-destructive research or same-sex marriage.".<ref name=nytimes />

Along with other public intellectuals, George played a key role in creating the "[[Theoconservatism|theoconservative]]" movement and integrating it into mainstream Republicanism.<ref name=Sullivan>Sullivan, Andrew. ''The Conservative Soul: How We Lost It, How to Get It Back''. New York: HarperCollins, 2006; {{ISBN|9780060188771}}.{{page needed|date=June 2015}}</ref> Much of George's work on religious liberty has centered on the idea that religion is a "distinct human good," which he asserts allows people to "live authentically by ordering one's life in line with one's best judgments of conscience."<ref>http://contemporarythinkers.org/robert-george/</ref>

George was threatened with death by pro-choice extremist [[Theodore Shulman]], who also targeted [[Priests for Life]] director Rev. [[Frank Pavone]], saying that they would be killed if the accused killer of Dr. [[George Tiller]] (a Wichita abortion-provider) was acquitted. For his crimes, Shulman was sentenced by Federal Judge [[Paul A. Crotty]] to 41 months' imprisonment, 3 years' [[United States federal probation and supervised release#Supervised release|supervised release]], and assessed a $100 special fee.<ref name = nydn>{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/abortion-extremist-faces-4-year-jail-term-article-1.1076120 |title=Abortion extremist faces 4-year jail term |last=Gearty |first= Robert |date=May 10, 2012 |publisher=''New York Daily News'' |access-date=June 27, 2016}}</ref>

==Perspectives of colleagues==

===Laudatory===
George has been called America's "most influential conservative Christian thinker" by David Kirkpatrick of the ''New York Times''.<ref name=nytimes>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/20/magazine/20george-t.html | work=The New York Times | first=David D. | last=Kirkpatrick | title=The Conservative-Christian Big Thinker | date=20 December 2009|accessdate=27 June 2015}}</ref> Kirkpatrick goes on to state:{{quote|"George’s admirers say he is revitalizing a strain of Catholic natural-law thinking that goes back to St. [[Thomas Aquinas]]. His scholarship has earned him accolades from religious and secular institutions alike. In one notable week two years ago, he received invitations to deliver prestigious lectures at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary and Harvard Law School."}}

In 2009, Supreme Court Justice and former Harvard Law School Dean [[Elena Kagan]] praised George as "one of the nation’s most respected legal theorists", saying that the respect he had gained was due to "his sheer brilliance, the analytic power of his arguments, the range of his knowledge", and "a deeply principled conviction, a profound and enduring integrity".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.senate.gov/fplayers/I2009/urlOfficeOpenPlayer.cfm?fn=9093039100519114801 |title=US Senate Url Video Player |publisher=Senate.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-06-27}}</ref> 

In announcing his election to Chair the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom in 2013, outgoing Chairwoman Katrina Lantos Swett, a Democrat appointed by Senate Majority Leader [[Harry Reid]], praised George as "a true human rights champion whose compassion for victims of oppression and wisdom about international religious freedom shine through all we have accomplished."<ref>{{cite web|title=Robert P.

===Critical===
{{expand section|balanced, sourced perspective, developed in parallel to next subsection, of laudatory and critical comments of reputable, notable individuals|small=no|date=June 2015}}
George's critics, including many Catholic scholars, have argued that he has neglected critical aspects of the Christian message, including "the corruption of human reason through original sin, the need for forgiveness and charity and the chance for redemption," focusing instead on "mechanics" of morality, and—through his political associations and activism—turned the church "into a tool of Republican Party".<ref name=nytimes/>

M. [[Cathleen Kaveny]], formerly of [[Notre Dame Law School]], and as of 2014, Darald and Juliet Libby Professor at [[Boston College]], a comparably credentialed scholar of law as well as theology, and like George, "in the Thomistic tradition," has called George and his allies "ecclesiastical bullies" and "Rambo Catholics" for such statements as his comparison of Catholic scholars supporting abortion rights to "defenders of chattel slavery."<ref name=nytimes/>

==Musical activity==
George is a finger style guitarist and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] banjo player. His guitar playing is in the style of [[Chet Atkins]] and [[Jerry Reed]]. His banjo playing mixes the styles of [[Earl Scruggs]], [[Don Reno]], and [[Bela Fleck]]. As a teenager, he performed with folk groups and bluegrass bands in coffee houses, rod and gun clubs, and at state and county fairs in West Virginia, Maryland, and Virginia.  At Swarthmore he led "Robby George and Friends", a country and bluegrass band. He performs in New Jersey with the band "Blue Heart".<ref>[http://www.blueheartband.com]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528103822/http://www.blueheartband.com |date=May 28, 2013 }}</ref>
