'''Robert Nozick''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|oʊ|z|ɪ|k}}; November 16, 1938&nbsp;– January 23, 2002) was an [[United States|American]] [[philosopher]]. He held the Joseph Pellegrino [[Harvard University Professor|University Professorship]] at [[Harvard University]], and was president of the [[American Philosophical Association]]. He is best known for his books ''[[Philosophical Explanations]]'' (1981), which included his counterfactual theory of knowledge, and ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'' (1974), a [[libertarianism|libertarian]] answer to [[John Rawls]]' ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' (1971), in which Nozick also presented his own theory of utopia as one in which people can freely choose the rules of the society they enter into. His other work involved [[ethics]], [[decision theory]], [[philosophy of mind]], [[metaphysics]] and [[epistemology]]. His final work before his death, ''Invariances'' (2001), introduced his theory of evolutionary [[cosmology]], by which he argues invariances, and hence objectivity itself, emerged through a theory of evolutionary cosmology across [[possible worlds]].<ref>Dictionary of Modern American Philosophers, Volume 1, edited by John R. Shook, A&C Black, 2005, p.1838</ref>.

==Personal life==
Nozick was born in [[Brooklyn]] to a family of [[Kohen|Kohenic]] descent.  His mother was born Sophie Cohen, and his father was a Jew from the Russian [[shtetl]] who had been born with the name of Cohen and who ran a small business.

He attended the public schools in Brooklyn.  At one point he joined the youth branch of [[Norman Thomas]]'s Socialist Party.  In addition, at [[Columbia University|Columbia]] he founded the local chapter of the [[Students for a Democratic Society|Student League for Industrial Democracy]], which in 1962 changed its name to [[Students for a Democratic Society]].

That same year, after receiving his bachelor of arts degree in 1959, he married Barbara Fierer. They had two children, Emily and David. The Nozicks eventually divorced and he remarried, to the poet [[Gjertrud Schnackenberg]].  He died in 2002 after a prolonged struggle with [[stomach cancer]].<ref>For biographies, memorials, and obituaries see:

==Career and works==
Nozick was educated at [[Columbia University|Columbia]] ([[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] 1959, ''[[summa cum laude]]''), where he studied with [[Sidney Morgenbesser]], and later at [[Princeton University|Princeton]] ([[Ph.D.]] 1963) under [[Carl Hempel]], and at [[Oxford University|Oxford]] as a [[Fulbright Scholar]] (1963–1964).

===Political philosophy===
{{Main article|Anarchy, State, and Utopia}}

For ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'' (1974) Nozick received a [[National Book Award]] in [[List of winners of the National Book Award#Science, Philosophy and Religion|category Philosophy and Religion]].<ref name=nba1975>
[http://www.nationalbook.org/nba1975.html "National Book Awards – 1975"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110909065656/http://www.nationalbook.org/nba1975.html |date=2011-09-09 }}. [[National Book Foundation]]. Retrieved 2012-03-08.</ref>
There, Nozick argues that only a [[Minarchism|minimal]] state "limited to the narrow functions of protection against force, theft, fraud, enforcement of contracts, and so on" could be justified without violating people's rights. For Nozick, a distribution of goods is just if brought about by [[Free market|free exchange]] among consenting adults from a ''just'' starting position, even if large [[Economic inequality|inequalities]] subsequently emerge from the process. Nozick appealed to the [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] idea that people should be treated as ends (what he termed 'separateness of persons'), not merely as a means to some other end.

Nozick challenged the partial conclusion of [[John Rawls]]' Second Principle of Justice of his ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'', that "social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are to be of greatest benefit to the least-advantaged members of society." ''Anarchy, State, and Utopia'' claims a heritage from [[John Locke]]'s ''[[Two Treatises of Government#Second Treatise|Second Treatise on Government]]'' and seeks to ground itself upon a [[natural law]] doctrine, but reaches some importantly different conclusions from Locke himself in several ways.

Most controversially, Nozick argued that a consistent upholding of the [[non-aggression principle]] would allow and regard as valid consensual or non-coercive [[Slavery|enslavement]] contracts between adults. He rejected the notion of [[inalienable rights]] advanced by Locke and most contemporary capitalist-oriented libertarian academics, writing in ''Anarchy, State, and Utopia'' that the typical notion of a "free system" would allow adults to voluntarily enter into non-coercive [[Voluntary slavery|slave contracts]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ellerman|first1=David|title=''Translatio'' versus ''Concessio'': Retrieving the Debate about Contracts of Alienation with an Application to Today’s Employment Contract|journal=Politics & Society|date=September 2005|volume=35|issue=3|page=449-80|doi=10.1177/0032329205278463|url=http://ellerman.org/Davids-Stuff/Econ&Pol-Econ/translatio-v-concessio-P-and-S-final.pdf|accessdate=17 April 2017|publisher=Sage Publications}}</ref><ref>[http://www.missouri.edu/~philrnj/nozick.html A summary of the political philosophy of Robert Nozick] by R.

===Epistemology===
In ''[[Philosophical Explanations]]'' (1981), which received the [[Phi Beta Kappa Society]]'s [[Ralph Waldo Emerson award|Ralph Waldo Emerson Award]], Nozick provided novel accounts of [[knowledge]], [[free will]], [[personal identity]], the nature of [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]], and the meaning of life. He also put forward an epistemological system which attempted to deal with both the [[Gettier problem]] and those posed by [[skepticism]]. This highly influential argument eschewed [[Theory of justification|justification]] as a necessary requirement for knowledge.<ref name=Schmidtz>{{cite book |author=Schmidtz, David |title=Robert Nozick |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2002 |pages= |isbn=0-521-00671-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>{{rp|ch. 7}}

Nozick's Four Conditions for S's knowing that P were:

# P is true
# S believes that P
# If it were the case that (not-P), S would not believe that P
# If it were the case that P, S would believe that P

Nozick's third and fourth conditions are [[counterfactuals]]. He called this the "tracking theory" of knowledge. Nozick believed the counterfactual conditionals bring out an important aspect of our intuitive grasp of knowledge: For any given fact, the believer's method must reliably track the truth despite varying relevant conditions. In this way, Nozick's theory is similar to [[reliabilism]]. Due to certain counterexamples that could otherwise be raised against these counterfactual conditions, Nozick specified that:

<ol start="3">
<li>If P weren’t the case and S were to use M to arrive at a belief whether or not P, then S wouldn’t believe, via M, that P.</li>
<li>If P were the case and S were to use M to arrive at a belief whether or not P, then S would believe, via M, that P.</li><ref>Keith Derose, Solving the Skeptical Problem</ref>
</ol>

Where M stands for the method by which S came to arrive at a belief whether or not P.

A major criticism of Nozick's theory of knowledge is his rejection of the  [[Deductive closure|principle of deductive closure]].  This principle states that if S knows X and S knows that X implies Y, then S knows Y.  Nozick's truth tracking conditions do not allow for the principle of deductive closure.  Nozick believes that the truth tracking conditions are more fundamental to human intuition than the principle of deductive closure.

===Later books===
''[[The Examined Life]]'' (1989), pitched to a broader public, explores love, death, faith, reality, and the meaning of life. According to [[Stephen Metcalf (writer)|Stephen Metcalf]], Nozick expresses serious misgivings about capitalist libertarianism, going so far as to reject much of the foundations of the theory on the grounds that personal freedom can sometimes only be fully actualized via a collectivist politics and that wealth is at times justly redistributed via taxation to protect the freedom of the many from the potential tyranny of an overly selfish and powerful few.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Metcalf|first1=Stephen|title=The Liberty Scam: Why even Robert Nozick, the philosophical father of libertarianism, gave up on the movement he inspired|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/the_dilettante/2011/06/the_liberty_scam.html|website=slate.com|accessdate=17 April 2017|date=June 24, 2011}}</ref> Nozick suggests that citizens who are opposed to wealth redistribution which fund programs they object to, should be able to opt out by supporting alternative government approved charities with an added 5% surcharge.<ref>Nozick, Robert (1989). "The Zigzag of Politics", The Examined Life: Philosophical Meditations. Simon & Schuster. {{ISBN|978-0-671-72501-3}}</ref>  However, Jeff Riggenbach has noted that "...in an interview conducted in July 2001, he stated that he had never stopped self-identifying as a libertarian. And Roderick Long reports that in his last book, ''[[Invariances]]'', [Nozick] identified voluntary cooperation as the 'core principle' of ethics, maintaining that the duty not to interfere with another person's 'domain of choice' is '[a]ll that any society should (coercively) demand'; higher levels of ethics, involving positive benevolence, represent instead a 'personal ideal' that should be left to 'a person's own individual choice and development.' And that certainly sounds like an attempt to embrace libertarianism all over again. My own view is that Nozick's thinking about these matters evolved over time and that what he wrote at any given time was an accurate reflection of what he was thinking at that time."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Riggenbach|first=Jeff|title=Anarchy, State, and Robert Nozick |journal=Mises Daily |publisher=[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] |date=November 26, 2010|url=https://mises.org/daily/4862/Anarchy-State-and-Robert-Nozick|accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref>

''[[The nature of rationality|The Nature of Rationality]]'' (1993) presents a theory of [[practical reason]] that attempts to embellish notoriously spartan classical [[decision theory]]. ''[[Socratic Puzzles]]'' (1997) is a collection of papers that range in topic from [[Ayn Rand]] and [[Austrian economics]] to [[animal rights]]. A thesis claims that "social ties are deeply interconnected with vital parts of Nozick's later philosophy", citing these two works as a development of ''The Examined Life''.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Leaving Libertarianism: Social Ties in Robert Nozick's New Philosophy|last = Herbjørnsrud|first = Dag|publisher = University of Oslo|year = 2002|isbn = |location = Oslo, Norway|pages = |url = https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/25070}}</ref> His last production, ''Invariances'' (2001), applies insights from physics and biology to questions of [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] in such areas as the nature of necessity and [[Goodness and value theory|moral value]].

===Utilitarianism===
Nozick created the thought experiment of the "[[utility monster]]" to show that average utilitarianism could lead to a situation where the needs of the vast majority were sacrificed for one individual. He also wrote a version of what was essentially a previously-known thought experiment, [[The Experience Machine]], in an attempt to show that ethical hedonism was false. Nozick asked us to imagine that "superduper neuropsychologists" have figured out a way to stimulate a person's brain to induce pleasurable experiences.<ref name=Schmidtz />{{rp| 210–11}} We would not be able to tell that these experiences were not real. He asks us, if we were given the choice, would we choose a machine-induced experience of a wonderful life over real life? Nozick says no, then asks whether we have reasons not to plug into the machine and concludes that since it does not seem to be rational to plug in, ethical hedonism must be false.

===Philosophical method===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}
Nozick was notable for the exploratory style of his philosophizing and for his methodological [[ecumenism]]. Often content to raise tantalizing philosophical possibilities and then leave judgment to the reader, Nozick was also notable for drawing from literature outside of philosophy (e.g., [[economics]], [[physics]], [[evolutionary biology]]).

===Invariances === 
In his 2001 work, ''Invariances'', Nozick introduces his theory of truth, in which he leans towards a [[deflationary theory of truth]], but argues that [[objectivity]] arises through being invariant under various transformations. For instance, space-time is a significant objective fact because an interval involving both temporal and spatial separation is invariant, whereas no simpler interval involving only temporal or only spatial separation is invariant under [[Lorentz transformations]]. Nozick argues that invariances, and hence objectivity itself, emerged through a theory of evolutionary cosmology across [[possible worlds]].<ref>Dictionary of Modern American Philosophers, Volume 1, edited by John R. Shook, A&C Black, 2005, p.1838</ref>
