'''Isaac Watts''' ({{IPAc-en|w|ɒ|t|s}}; 17 July 1674 – 25 November 1748) was an English Christian minister, [[hymn]] writer, [[theologian]], and [[logician]]. He was a prolific and popular hymn writer and is credited with some 750 hymns. He is recognized as the "Father of English [[Hymnody]];" many of his hymns remain in use today and have been translated into numerous languages.

==Life==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2014}}
Watts was born in [[Southampton]], England in 1674 and was brought up in the home of a committed religious [[Nonconformist]]; his father, also Isaac Watts, had been incarcerated twice for his views. Watts had a classical education at [[King Edward VI School, Southampton|King Edward VI School]], learning [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[Hebrew]].

Watts displayed a propensity for rhyme from an early age. He was once asked why he had his eyes open during prayers, to which he responded:
{{bq|text=<poem>A little mouse for want of stairs
ran up a rope to say its prayers.</poem>}}

He received [[corporal punishment]] for this, to which he cried:
{{bq|text=<poem>O father, father, pity take
And I will no more verses make.<ref>{{Citation | first = Norman | last = Mable | title = Popular Hymns and their Writers | page = 179}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | first = F. W. | last = Boreham | title = A Late Lark Singing | year = 1945 | page = 29}}.</ref></poem>}}

Watts could not attend [[Oxford University|Oxford]] or [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] because he was a noncomformist and these universities were restricted to Anglicans—as were government positions at the time. He went to the [[Dissenting academies|Dissenting Academy]] at [[Stoke Newington]] in 1690. Much of the remainder of his life centred around that village, which is now part of [[Inner London]].

Following his education, Watts was called as pastor of a large independent chapel in London where he helped train preachers, despite his poor health. He held religious opinions that were more nondenominational or [[ecumenical]] than was common for a nonconformist. He had a greater interest in promoting education and scholarship than preaching for any particular sect.

Watts took work as a private tutor and lived with the [[Nonconformist]] Hartopp family at [[Abney Park|Fleetwood House]] on [[Stoke Newington Church Street|Church Street]] in [[Stoke Newington]]. Through them, he became acquainted with their immediate neighbours Sir [[Thomas Abney]] and [[Lady Mary Abney|Lady Mary]]. He eventually lived for a total of 36 years in the Abney household, most of the time at Abney House, their second residence. (Lady Mary had inherited the manor of [[Stoke Newington]] in 1701 from her late brother Thomas Gunston.)

On the death of Sir [[Thomas Abney]] in 1722, his widow Lady Mary and her unmarried daughter Elizabeth moved all her household to [[Abney Hall]] from Hertfordshire, and she invited Watts to continue with them. He particularly enjoyed the grounds at [[Abney Park]], which Lady Mary planted with two elm walks leading down to an island [[heronry]] in the [[Hackney Brook]], and he often sought inspiration there for the many books and hymns that he wrote.

Watts lived at Abney Hall in Stoke Newington until his death in 1748; he was buried in [[Bunhill Fields]]. He left an extensive legacy of hymns, treatises, educational works, and essays. His work was influential amongst Nonconformist independents and religious revivalists of the 18th century, such as [[Philip Doddridge]], who dedicated his best-known work to Watts.

==Watts and hymnody==
Sacred music scholar Stephen Marini describes the ways in which Watts contributed to English hymnody. Watts led by including new poetry for "original songs of Christian experience" to be used in worship, according to Marini.{{Sfn | Marini | 2003 | p = 76}}  The older tradition was based on the poetry of the Bible, notably the [[Psalm]]s.  This had developed from the teachings of 16th-century [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] leader [[John Calvin]], who initiated the practice of creating verse translations of the Psalms in the vernacular for congregational singing.{{Sfn | Marini | 2003 | p = 71}}  Watts was not the first Protestant to promote the singing of hymns; however, his prolific hymnwriting helped usher in a new era of English worship as many other poets followed in his path.<ref>{{Harvnb | Marini | 2003 | p = 76}} lists hymn writers who followed in the tradition established by Watts, including  [[Charles Wesley]], [[Edward Perronet]], Ann Steele, [[Samuel Stennet]], [[Augustus Toplady]], [[John Newton]], [[William Cowper]], [[Reginald Heber]], [[Samuel Davies (Presbyterian educator)|Samuel Davies]], [[Timothy Dwight IV|Timothy Dwight]], [[John Leland (Baptist)|John Leland]], and [[Peter Cartwright (revivalist)|Peter Cartwright]].</ref>

Watts also introduced a new way of rendering the Psalms in verse for church services, proposing that they be adapted for hymns with a specifically Christian perspective.  As Watts put it in the title of his 1719 metrical Psalter, the Psalms should be "imitated in the language of the New Testament."{{Sfn | Marini | 2003 | p = 76}} Besides writing hymns, Isaac Watts was also a [[theologian]] and [[logician]], writing books and essays on these subjects.

<!---The following paragraph is hidden because it is largely incomprehensible. It needs to be MUCH better explicated before unhiding; otherwise, it can be deleted altogether: 
Marini discerns two particular trends in Watts' verses, which he calls "emotional subjectivity" and "doctrinal objectivity".  He suggests that "Watts' voice broke down the distance between poet and singer and invested the text with personal spirituality,"  As an example of this, he cites "[[When I Survey the Wondrous Cross]]".  By "doctrinal objectivity," Marini means that Watts verse achieved an "axiomatic quality" that "presented Christian doctrinal content with the explicit confidence that befits affirmations of faith."  As examples, Marini cites the hymns "[[Joy to the World]]" as well as "From All That Dwell Below the Skies":{{Sfn | Marini | 2003 | p = 76}}
From all that dwell below the skies
Let the Creator's praise arise;
Let the Redeemer's name be sung
Through every land, by every tongue.--->

===Logic===
[[File:Isaac Watts.jpg|thumb|upright|Isaac Watts]]
Watts wrote a textbook on [[logic]] which was particularly popular; its full title was, ''Logic, or The Right Use of Reason in the Enquiry After Truth With a Variety of Rules to Guard Against Error in the Affairs of Religion and Human Life, as well as in the Sciences''. This was first published in 1724, and it was printed in twenty editions.

Watts wrote this work for beginners of logic, and arranged the book methodically. He divided the content of his elementary treatment of logic into four parts: [[perception]], [[judgement]], [[reasoning]], and [[wikt:method|method]], which he treated in this order. Each of these parts is divided into chapters, and some of these chapters are divided into sections. The content of the chapters and sections is subdivided by the following devices: divisions, distributions, notes, observations, directions, rules, illustrations, and remarks. Every contentum of the book comes under one or more of these headings, and this methodical arrangement serves to make the exposition clear.

In Watts' ''Logic,'' there are notable departures from other works of the time, and some notable innovations. The influence of British [[empiricism]] may be seen, especially that of contemporary [[philosopher]] and empiricist [[John Locke]].  ''Logic'' includes several references to Locke and his ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'',{{Sfn | Watts | 1825 | p = 14}} in which he espoused his empiricist views. Watts was careful to distinguish between [[judgment|judgements]] and [[proposition]]s, unlike some other logic authors. According to Watts, judgement is "to compare... ideas together, and to join them by [[Proposition|affirmation]], or disjoin then by [[negation]], according as we find them to agree or disagree".{{Sfn | Watts | 1825 | p = 115}}  He continues, "when mere ideas are joined in the mind without words, it is rather called a judgement; but when clothed with words it is called a proposition".{{Sfn | Watts | 1825 | p = 117}}  Watts' ''Logic'' follows the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition and divides propositions into universal affirmative, universal negative, particular affirmative, and particular negative.

In the third part, Watts discusses [[reasoning]] and [[argumentation]], with particular emphasis on the theory of [[syllogism]]. This was considered a centrally important part of [[classical logic]]. According to Watts, and in keeping with logicians of his day, Watts defined logic as an art (see [[liberal arts]]), as opposed to a [[science]]. Throughout ''Logic,'' Watts revealed his high conception of logic by stressing the [[practical]] side of logic, rather than the [[speculative philosophy|speculative]] side. According to Watts, as a practical art, logic can be really useful in any inquiry, whether it is an inquiry in the arts, or inquiry in the sciences, or inquiry of an [[ethics|ethical]] kind. Watts' emphasis on logic as a practical art distinguishes his book from others.

By stressing a practical and non-formal part of logic, Watts gave rules and directions for any kind of inquiry, including the inquiries of science and the inquiries of [[philosophy]]. These rules of inquiry were given in addition to the formal content of classical logic common to textbooks on logic from that time. Watts' conception of logic as being divided into its practical part and its speculative part marks a departure from the conception of logic of most other authors. His conception of logic is more akin to that of the later, nineteenth-century logician, [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C. S. Peirce]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Isaac Watts' ''Logic'' became the standard text on logic at [[Oxford University|Oxford]], [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]], [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and [[Yale University|Yale]], being used at Oxford for well over 100 years. C. S. Peirce, the great nineteenth-century logician, wrote favorably of Watts' ''Logic''. When preparing his own textbook, entitled ''A Critick of Arguments: How to Reason'' (also known as the ''Grand Logic''), Peirce wrote,  'I shall suppose the reader to be acquainted with what is contained in Dr Watts' ''Logick'', a book... far superior to the treatises now used in colleges, being the production of a man distinguished for good sense.' <ref>Peirce, C. S. (1933) ''The Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, vol. II'', Paul Weiss and Charles Hartshorne, eds. Cambridge MASS, Harvard University Press{{page needed|date=January 2014}}</ref>

Watts followed the ''Logic'' in 1741 by a supplement, ''The Improvement of the Mind.'' This also went through numerous editions and later inspired [[Michael Faraday]]. It was also widely used as a moral textbook in schools.

==Legacy, honours and memorials==
[[File:Isaac Watts DD tomb in Bunhill Fields.jpg|thumb|left|Isaac Watts' tomb in [[Bunhill Fields]]]]
[[File:Abneysharelist.jpeg|thumb|upright|London's only public statue to Isaac Watts is in [[Abney Park Cemetery|Abney Park]], [[Stoke Newington]].]]
[[File:Watts Park.jpg|thumb|Statue of Isaac Watts in Watts Park, Southampton (city of his birth)]]

On his death, Isaac Watts' papers were given to [[Yale University]] in the [[Colony of Connecticut]], which Nonconformists had established. [[Southampton|King Edward VI School]], which he attended, named one of its [[House system|houses]] "Watts" in his honour.

The [[Church of England]] and [[Lutheran Church]] remember Watts (and his ministerial service) annually in the [[Calendar of Saints (Lutheran)|Calendar of Saints]] on 25 November, and the [[Episcopal Church (USA)|Episcopal Church]] on the following day.

The earliest surviving built memorial to Isaac Watts is at [[Westminster Abbey]]; this was completed shortly after his death. His much-visited chest tomb at [[Bunhill Fields]], dates from 1808, replacing the original that had been paid for and erected by [[Lady Mary Abney]] and the Hartopp family.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1396517 | title=MONUMENT TO ISAAC WATTS, EAST ENCLOSURE | publisher=English Heritage | work=List entry Number: 1396517 | accessdate=24 February 2014}}</ref> A stone bust of Watts is installed at the Nonconformist [[Dr Williams's Library]], in central London. The earliest public statue, erected in 1845, stands at [[Abney Park Cemetery|Abney Park]], where Watts had lived for more than 30 years at the manor house, where he also died. The park was later devoted to uses as a cemetery and public arboretum. A later, rather similar statue was funded by public subscription and erected in a new Victorian public park named for Watts in Southampton, the city of his birth. In the mid-nineteenth century, the Congregational Dr Watts Memorial Hall was built in Southampton and named for him. After [[World War II]], it was lost to redevelopment. The Isaac Watts Memorial United Reformed Church was built on the site and named for him. One of the earliest built memorials may also now be lost: a bust to Watts that was commissioned on his death for the London chapel with which he was associated. The chapel was demolished in the late 18th century; remaining parts of the memorial were rescued at the last minute by a wealthy landowner for installation in his chapel near [[Liverpool]]. It is unclear whether the bust survives. The stone statue in front of the [[Abney Park Chapel]] at Dr Watts' Walk, Abney Park Cemetery, was erected in 1845 by public subscription. It was designed by the leading British [[Sculpture|sculptor]], [[Edward Hodges Baily]] [[Royal Academy|RA]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]]. A scheme for a commemorative statue on this spot had first been promoted in the late 1830s by [[George Collison]], who in 1840 published an engraving as the frontispiece of his book about cemetery design in Europe and America; and at [[Abney Park Cemetery]] in particular. This first cenotaph proposal was never commissioned, and Baily's later design was adopted in 1845. In 1974, the City of Southampton (Watts' home city) commemorated the 300 year anniversary of his birth by commissioning the biography ''Isaac Watts Remembered'', written by David G. Fountain, who like Watts, was also a non-conformist minister from Southampton.

==Cultural or contemporary influences==

One of Watts' best-known poems was an exhortation "[[wikisource:Against Idleness and Mischief|Against Idleness and Mischief]]" in ''[[Divine Songs for Children]].'' This was [[parody|parodied]] by [[Lewis Carroll]] in the poem "[[How Doth the Little Crocodile]]", included in his book ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]].'' His parody is better known than the original Watts' poem. The poem was also featured in the segment on the cartoon program "Rocky and His Friends" called "Bullwinkle's Corner", in which Bullwinkle Moose recites poetry. In this case, the poem was entitled "The Bee" with no author credit. 

In his novel, ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'' (1850), [[Charles Dickens]] has school master Dr. Strong quote from Watts' "Against Idleness and Mischief".

The 1884 [[comic opera]] ''[[Princess Ida]]'' includes a punning reference to Watts in Act I.  At Princess Ida's women's university, no males are allowed. Her father King Gama says that "She'll scarcely suffer Dr. Watts' 'hymns'".

A poem often referred to as "False Greatness" by [[Joseph Merrick]] ("The Elephant Man"), which was used in writing or "signature block" by Merrick, starting "Tis true, my form is something odd
but blaming me, is blaming God... "  is often (incorrectly) quoted or cited as a work by Isaac Watts. In fact only the last few sentences were penned by Watts ( "False Greatness" , book II-Horae lyricae 1743 ) starting "Mylo, forbear to call him bless'd That only boasts a large estate..." <ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=1bMyAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA193&lpg=PA193&dq=Mylo,+forbear+to+call+him+bless%27d+That+only+boasts+a+large+estate&source=bl&ots=Pq2SLl6SvZ&sig=Uu5uA9-Iaq2lAh_FKLL5Oz3puaA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwik79mN1tnRAhUQz2MKHeUUDrQQ6AEIIzAD#v=onepage&q=Mylo%2C%20forbear%20to%20call%20him%20bless%27d%20That%20only%20boasts%20a%20large%20estate&f=false</ref>
