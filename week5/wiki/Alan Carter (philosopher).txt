Some of Carter's work in environmental philosophy is discussed critically by [[Robin Attfield]].<ref name="Attfield">See for example Attfield, R., ''Environmental Ethics: An Overview for the Twenty-First Century''. Polity-Blackwell (2003).</ref> Carter's state-primacy theory has been discussed by [[Robyn Eckersley]]<ref name="Eckersley">Eckersley, R. ''The Green State: Rethinking Democracy and Sovereignty''. MIT Press (2004).</ref> and criticized by [[John Barry (politician)|John Barry]].<ref name="Barry">Barry, J. ''Rethinking Green Politics: Nature, Virtue and Progress''. Sage (1999)</ref> and, most fully, by Simon Hailwood.<ref name="Hailwood">Hailwood, S. ''How to be a Green Liberal: Nature, Value and Liberal Philosophy''. Acumen (2004).</ref> Carter has responded by arguing that his critics fail to take sufficiently into account the problems the military causes in modern societies: "it is telling how little attention green liberal critics of the state-primacy theory have paid to the role of the military and to its highly distorting effects. Failing to examine in any detail military requirements within ostensibly ‘liberal democracies’, whether existing or imagined, is more like simply ignoring an argument rather than answering it."<ref name="Carter">Carter, A. "Beyond primacy: Marxism, anarchism and radical green political theory," ''Environmental Politics'' 19, 6 (2010): 951-972, here at 971n.</ref>

Carter was one of the founder members of the London-based Anarchist Research Group.<ref name="Goodway">Goodway, D. (ed.), ''[[For Anarchism: History, Theory, and Practice]]''. Routledge (1989).</ref> [[Colin Ward]] has described Carter, with [[Murray Bookchin]], as one of the leading [[eco-anarchism|eco-anarchist]] thinkers.<ref name="Ward">Ward, C. ''Anarchism: A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford University Press (2004).</ref>
