[[File:Portrait - Victor Basch - 1926.jpg|thumb|Victor Basch (1926).]]

'''Basch Viktor Vilém''', or '''Victor-Guillaume Basch''' (18 August 1863/1865, [[Budapest]] – 10 January 1944) was a French politician of [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] descent and a professor of germanistics and philosophy at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. He was engaged in the [[Zionist Movement]], in the [[Human Rights League (France)|Ligue des droits de l'homme]] (president from 1926 to 1944) and he also engaged in [[Anti-nazism]] .

His father was the journalist and political activist, [[Raphael Basch]]. Born in Budapest in 1863, Victor Basch emigrated with his family to [[France]] as a child, and later studied at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. In 1885 he was appointed professor at the [[University of Nancy]], and in 1887 he was appointed professor at the University of [[Rennes]], where he became a friend of [[Jean Jaurès]]. During the [[Dreyfus affair]] Basch was the leader of the Dreyfusards at Rennes, who were placed in a serious and difficult position when the case was tried in that city. Both as a Jew and as a Dreyfusard, Basch was subjected to [[persecution]] at the hands of the fanatical [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] populace. In a 1916 interview cited by his biographer and granddaughter, the French historian [[Françoise Basch]], Victor Basch declared, " I'm really a Jew. I struggle and suffered for my Jewishness."<ref>Basch, Françoise ''Victor Basch: de l'affaire Dreyfus au crime de la milice.'' Librairie Plon. Paris: 1994.</ref> However, biographer Françoise Basch underscores the view that her grandfather identified with his family's history and the suffering of [[Persecution of Jews|persecuted Jews]], and not with [[Judaism]] as a [[religion]] per se. As a member of the [[League against Imperialism]] created in Brussels in 1927, and as the President of the Ligue des Droits de l'Homme from 1926 to 1944, Basch was one of the architects of the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]]. He fought and suffered for the principles of legal and social justice and [[human rights]].

On 10 January 1944, Victor Basch and his wife, Ilona Basch (née Helene Furth) aged 81, were taken from their home in [[Lyon]] and [[Assassination|assassinated]] by Joseph Lecussan and Henri Gonnet, two members of the antisemitic Vichy French [[Milice|Milice Française]] under orders issued to them by its regional chief [[Paul Touvier]].
