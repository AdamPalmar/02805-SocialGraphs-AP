'''Julian Savulescu''' (born 22 December 1963) is an Australian philosopher and bioethicist. He is Uehiro Professor of Practical Ethics at the [[University of Oxford]], Fellow of [[St Cross College, Oxford]], Director of the [[Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics]], Sir Louis Matheson Distinguished Visiting Professor at [[Monash University]], and Head of the Melbourne–Oxford Stem Cell Collaboration, which is devoted to examining the ethical implications of [[cloning]] and [[embryonic stem cell research]]. He is the editor of the ''[[Journal of Medical Ethics]]'', which is ranked as the [http://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=med_bioethics No.1 journal in bioethics] worldwide by Google Scholar Metrics as of 2013. In addition to his background in applied ethics and philosophy, he also has a background in medicine and completed his [[MBBS]] (Hons) at Monash University.

He completed his PhD at Monash University, under the supervision of bioethicist [[Peter Singer]].<ref>[http://media.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/uehiro/Savulescu.mp3 Savulescu]. philosophy.ox.ac.uk</ref>

== Procreative beneficence ==
Julian Savulescu coined the phrase ''procreative beneficence''.  It is the controversial<ref>{{cite journal |author=de Melo-Martin I |title=On our obligation to select the best children: a reply to Savulescu |journal=Bioethics |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=72–83 |year=2004 |pmid=15168699|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8519.2004.00379.x}}</ref> putative [[moral obligation]] of [[parent]]s in a position to select their children, for instance through [[Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis|preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] (PGD), to favor those expected to have the best life.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Savulescu J |authorlink=Julian Savulescu |title=Procreative beneficence: why we should select the best children |journal=Bioethics |volume=15 |issue=5–6 |pages=413–26 |date=October 2001 |pmid=12058767 |doi=10.1111/1467-8519.00251}}</ref> An argument in favor of this principle is that traits (such as empathy, memory, etc.) are "all-purpose means" in the sense of being instrumental in realizing whatever life plans the child may come to have.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Hens | first1 = K. | last2 = Dondorp | first2 = W. | last3 = Handyside | first3 = A.

In some of his publications he has argued for the following: (1) that parents have a responsibility to select the best children they could have, given all of the relevant genetic information available to them, a principle that he extends to the use of in-vitro fertilization (IVF) and preimplantation genetic diagnoses (PGD) in order to determine the intelligence of embryos and possible children;<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/1467-8519.00251|pmid=12058767|title=Procreative Beneficence: Why We Should Select the Best Children|journal=Bioethics|volume=15|issue=5–6|pages=413–26|year=2001|last1=Savulescu|first1=Julian}}</ref> and (2) that stem cell research is justifiable even if one accepts the view of the embryo as a person.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=12472112|year=2002|author1=Savulescu|first1=J|title=The embryonic stem cell lottery and the cannibalization of human beings|journal=Bioethics|volume=16|issue=6|pages=508–29|doi=10.1111/1467-8519.00308}}</ref>

Julian Savulescu also justifies the destruction of embryos and fetuses as a source of organs and tissue for transplantation to adults.<ref>{{cite journal|pmc=479188|pmid=10226910|year=1999|author1=Savulescu|first1=J|title=Should we clone human beings? Cloning as a source of tissue for transplantation|journal=Journal of medical ethics|volume=25|issue=2|pages=87–95|doi=10.1136/jme.25.2.87}}</ref> In his abstract he argues, 
"The most publicly justifiable application of human cloning, if there is one at all, is to provide self-compatible cells or tissues for medical use, especially transplantation. Some have argued that this raises no new ethical issues above those raised by any form of embryo experimentation. I argue that this research is less morally problematic than other embryo research. Indeed, it is not merely morally permissible but morally required that we employ cloning to produce embryos or fetuses for the sake of providing cells, tissues or even organs for therapy, followed by abortion of the embryo or fetus."  He argues that if it is permissible to destroy fetuses, for social reasons, or no reasons at all, it must be justifiable to destroy them to save lives.

Along with neuro-ethicist [[Guy Kahane]], Savulescu's article "Brain Damage and the Moral Significance of Consciousness" appears to be the first mainstream publication to argue that increased evidence of consciousness in patients diagnosed with being in [[persistent vegetative state]] actually ''supports'' withdrawing or withholding care.<ref>{{cite journal|doi= 10.1093/jmp/jhn038|title= Brain Damage and the Moral Significance of Consciousness|journal= Journal of Medicine and Philosophy|year= 2009|last1= Savulescu|first1= J.|last2= Kahane|first2= G.}}</ref>

In 2009, Professor Savulescu presented a paper at the ’Festival of Dangerous Ideas,’ held at the Sydney Opera House in October 2009, entitled "Unfit for Life: Genetically Enhance Humanity or Face Extinction," which appears on Vimeo.<ref>[http://vimeo.com/7515623 Genetically enhance humanity or face extinction – PART 1 on Vimeo]. Vimeo.com (9 November 2009). Retrieved on 2016-05-16.</ref>  Savulescu argues that humanity is on the brink of disappearing in a metaphorical ‘Bermuda Triangle’ unless humans are willing to undergo 'moral enhancement'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.l.u-tokyo.ac.jp/shiseigaku/pdf/NL28-29e.pdf|title=Death and Life Studies, Fit for the Future?

== Reception ==
Robert Sparrow wrote, in the [[Journal of Medical Ethics]], that Savulescu's justification for the principle of procreative beneficence can and should be extended further. If parents have a moral obligation to create children likely to have the best possible life, they should prefer to have children that have been genetically engineered for an optimal chance at such a life, even if those children bear little or no genetic relation to them.<ref name="sparrow">{{cite journal |last=Sparrow |first=Robert |date=4 April 2013 |title=In vitro eugenics|journal=[[Journal of Medical Ethics]] |volume=40 |issue=11 |page=725 |doi=10.1136/medethics-2012-101200}}</ref>

Rebecca Bennett, however, criticizes Savulescu's argument. Bennett argues that "the chances of any particular individual being born is spectacularly unlikely, given the infinite number of variables that had to be in place for this to happen. In order for any particular individual to exist, that individual's parents have to have been created in the first place, they have to meet at the right time and conceive us at a particular time to enable that particular sperm to fuse with that particular egg. Thus, it is clear that all sorts of things, any change in society, will effect who is born.". According to Bennett, this means that no-one is actually harmed if one does not select the best offspring, as the individuals born could not have had any other, worse life as they would otherwise never have been born - "choosing worthwhile but impaired lives harms no-one and is thus not less preferable", as Bennett puts it. Bennett argues that while advocates of procreative beneficence could appeal to impersonal harm, which is where one should aim to ensure the maximum possible potential quality of life and thus embryos without or with the least impairments should be selected (as the impersonal total quality of life will be improved), this argument is flawed on two counts. Firstly on an intuitive level, Bennett questions if benefit or harm that doesn't affect anyone (i.e it is impersonal) should be worthy of consideration as no actual people will gain or lose anything. Secondly and on a theoretical level, Bennett argues that attempting to increase the sum total impersonal happiness (or decrease impersonal harm) can lead to repugnant conclusions, such as being obliged to produce as many offspring as possible to bring more people into the world to raise the level of impersonal happiness, even if the quality of life of individuals suffers for it due to scarcity and overcrowding. Bennett argues that this conclusion is repugnant because "it cares little about what we normally regard as morally important: the welfare of individual people"<ref>Bennett, Rebecca, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bioe.12044/full "When intuition is Not Enough. Why the Principle of Procreative Beneficence Must Work Much Harder to Justify Its Eugenic Vision"], Wiley Online Library, accessed 14/08/2017,</ref>.
