== Works ==
In his book ''Marxism and Revisionism in Italy'' (1971) he regards [[Gentile]]'s thought as the philosophical keystone of Italian Marxism. He is the author of ''The Political and the Transformations'' (1979) and ''Power and Secularization'' (1985). He has been one of the most important re-discoverers of [[Carl Schmitt]]'s thought and of [[decisionism]].

In 2006 a collection of essays was published to celebrate his 60th birthday (Figure del conflitto, Valter Casini Editore, Roma), with international contributions by, among others: [[Remo Bodei]], [[Massimo Cacciari]], Franco Rella, [[Manfred Frank]], [[Jean L. Cohen]], [[Adriana Cavarero]], [[Homi K. Bhabha]], [[Antonio Negri]], [[Rüdiger Bubner]], [[Axel Honneth]], [[Marc Augé]], Manuel Cruz, Jorge E. Dotti, and [[Salvador Giner]].

In 2015, to Marramao's thesis on the "philosophy of globalization" was devoted an entire issue of the US magazine "Politica Común": ''On Giacomo Marramao's "The Passage West"'', University of Michigan Library, Ann Arbor (with contributions of Peter Baker, Stefano Franchi, Martin Jay, Andy Lantz, Manuela Marchesini, Alberto Moreiras, Pedro Ángel Palou, Carlos Rodríguez, Teresa M. Vilarós, Hayden White, and with a broad response of Marramao). Of this volume was published an italian edition: ''Filosofia dei mondi globali. Conversazioni con Giacomo Marramao'', ed. by Stefano Franchi and Manuela Marchesini, Bollati Boringhieri, Torino 2017 ({{ISBN|978-88-339-2845-6}}).

== Philosophical stance ==
Starting from the study of Italian and European Marxism (''Marxism and Revisionism in Italy'', 1971; ''Austro-Marxism and left wing Socialism between the two Wars'', 1977), Marramao has analysed the political categories of modernity suggesting – on the same wavelength as the [[Frankfurt School]] (''The political and its transformations'', 1979) and [[Max Weber]] (''The disenchanted order'', 1985)– an innovative symbolic-genealogical reconstruction of them. According to this view, which recovers [[Karl Löwith]]'s historical-philosophical hypothesis, in modern forms of social organizations there are settled meanings deriving from a process of secularization of religious contents – that is, the re-proposal of the Christian symbolic horizon inside a worldly dimension. In particular, secularization finds its centre in a process of "temporalization of history" thanks to which the categories of time (that translate Christian [[eschatology]] into a generic opening to the future: progress, revolution, liberation, etc.) gain an increasing centrality in the political representations of Modernity.

Based on these reflections, also exposed in ''After the Leviathan'', 1995 (third edition in 2013) and ''The Passion of the Present'', 2008, a clear thematization of the philosophical problem of time has grown up. In opposition to [[Henri Bergson]]'s and [[Martin Heidegger]]'s views, which delineate with different shades a pure form of temporality, more original than its representations and spatializations, Marramao declares that the link time-space is inseparable and, also connecting to contemporary Physics, he asserts that the structure of Time possesses an aporetic and impure profile, compared to which the dimension of space is the formal reference necessary to think its paradoxes (''Minima temporalia'', 1990, new edition in 2005; ''Kairos: Towards an Ontology of Due Time'', 1992, new edition in 2005).
