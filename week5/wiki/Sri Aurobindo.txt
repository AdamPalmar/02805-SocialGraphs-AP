{{Sri Aurobindo}}
{{Hindu philosophy}}
'''Sri Aurobindo''' ({{IPA-bn|Sri Ôrobindo|lang}}) (born '''Aurobindo Ghose'''; 15 August 1872&nbsp;– 5 December 1950) was an Indian philosopher, [[yogi]], [[guru]], poet, and [[Indian nationalism|nationalist]].{{sfnp|McDermott|1994|pp=11–12, 14|ps=}} He joined the [[Indian independence movement|Indian movement]] for independence from [[British Raj|British rule]], for a while was one of its influential leaders and then became a spiritual reformer, introducing his visions on human progress and [[spiritual evolution]].

Aurobindo studied for the [[Imperial Civil Service|Indian Civil Service]] at [[King's College, Cambridge]], [[England]]. After returning to India he took up various civil service works under the [[maharaja]] of the [[princely state]] of [[Baroda State|Baroda]] and began increasingly involved in [[Indian National Congress|nationalist politics]] and the [[Anushilan Samiti|nascent revolutionary movement in Bengal]]. He was arrested in the aftermath of a number of bomb outrages linked [[Anushilan samiti|to his organisation]], but in a highly public trial where he [[Emperor vs Aurobindo Ghosh and others|faced charges of treason]], Aurobindo could only be convicted and imprisoned for writing articles against [[British India|British rule]] in India. He was released when no evidence could be provided, following the murder of a prosecution-witness during the trial. During his stay in the jail he had mystical and spiritual experiences, after which he moved to [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]], leaving politics for [[Spirituality|spiritual]] work.

During his stay in Pondicherry, Aurobindo developed a method of spiritual practice he called [[Integral Yoga]]. The central theme of his vision was the evolution of human life into a life [[divine]]. He believed in a spiritual realisation that not only liberated man but transformed his nature, enabling a divine life on earth. In 1926, with the help of his spiritual collaborator, [[Mirra Alfassa]] (referred to as "The Mother"), he founded the [[Sri Aurobindo Ashram]]. He died on 5 December 1950 in Pondicherry.

His main literary works are ''The Life Divine'', which deals with theoretical aspects of Integral Yoga; ''Synthesis of Yoga'', which deals with practical guidance to Integral Yoga; and ''[[Savitri: A Legend and a Symbol]]'', an [[epic poem]]. His works also include philosophy, poetry, translations and commentaries on the ''[[Vedas]]'', ''[[Upanishads]]'' and the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]''. He was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1943 and for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1950.<ref>[https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=567 Nomination database] Nobel.org accessed 28 January 2016</ref>

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===

Aurobindo Ghose was born in [[Calcutta]] (now Kolkata), [[Bengal Presidency]], India on 15 August 1872 . His father, Krishna Dhun Ghose, was then Assistant Surgeon of [[Rangpur District|Rangpur]] in Bengal, and a former member of the [[Brahmo Samaj]] religious reform movement who had become enamoured with the then-new idea of [[evolution]] while pursuing medical studies in Britain.{{efn|Aurobindo described his father as a "tremendous atheist" but Thakur calls him an agnostic and Heehs believes that he followed his own coda.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|pp=3–7, 10|ps=}}{{sfnp|Thakur|2004|p=3|ps=}}}} His mother was Swarnalata Devi, whose father was [[Rajnarayan Bose|Shri Rajnarayan Bose]], a leading figure in the Samaj. She had been sent to the more salubrious surroundings of Calcutta for Aurobindo's birth. Aurobindo had two elder siblings, Benoybhusan and [[Manmohan Ghose|Manmohan]], a younger sister, Sarojini, and a younger brother, [[Barindra Kumar Ghosh|Barindrakumar]] (also referred to as Barin).{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|pp=3–7, 10|ps=}}{{sfnp|Thakur|2004|p=3|ps=}}

Young Aurobindo was brought up speaking English but used [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] to communicate with servants. Although his family were [[Bengali people|Bengali]], his father believed British culture to be superior. He and his two elder siblings were sent to the English-speaking [[Loreto Convent, Darjeeling|Loreto House]] boarding school in [[Darjeeling]], in part to improve their language skills and in part to distance them from their mother, who had developed a mental illness soon after the birth of her first child. Darjeeling was a centre of British life in India and the school was run by Irish nuns, through which the boys would have been exposed to Christian religious teachings and symbolism.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|pp=8–9|ps=}}

=== England (1879–1893) ===

[[File:Aurobindo.family.jpg|125px|thumb|upright|left|Aurobindo (seated center next to his mother) and his family. In England, ca. 1879.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=10|ps=}}]]

Krishna Dhun Ghose wanted his sons to enter the [[Indian Civil Service (British India)|Indian Civil Service]] (ICS), an elite organisation comprising around 1000 people. To achieve this it was necessary that they study in England and so it was there that the entire family moved in 1879.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|pp=9–10|ps=}}{{efn|Krishna Dhun Ghose returned to India soon after, leaving his wife in the care of a physician in London. Barindra was born in England in January 1880.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=10|ps=}}}} The three brothers were placed in the care of the Reverend W. H. Drewett in [[Manchester]].{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|pp=9–10|ps=}} Drewett was a minister of the  [[Congregational Church]] whom Krishna Dhun Ghose knew through his British friends at Rangapur.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|pp=10, 13|ps=}}{{efn|While in Manchester, the Ghose brothers lived first at 84 Shakespeare Street and then, by the time of the 1881 census, at 29 York Place, [[Chorlton-on-Medlock]]. Aurbindo was recorded in the census as Aravinda Ghose, as he was also by the University of Cambridge.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=14|ps=}}{{sfn|1881 Census|ps=}}{{sfn|ACAD|GHS890AA}}}}

The boys were taught [[Latin (language)|Latin]] by Drewett and his wife. This was a prerequisite  for admission to good English schools and, after two years, in 1881, the elder two siblings were enrolled at [[Manchester Grammar School]]. Aurobindo was considered too young for enrolment and he continued his studies with the Drewetts, learning history, Latin, [[French language|French]], geography and arithmetic. Although the Drewetts were told not to teach religion, the boys inevitably were exposed to Christian teachings and events, which generally bored Aurobindo and sometimes repulsed him. There was little contact with his father, who wrote only a few letters to his sons while they were in England, but what communication there was indicated that he was becoming less endeared to the British in India than he had been, on one occasion describing the British Raj as a "heartless government".{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=14|ps=}}
[[File:Basement of 49 St Stephen's Avenue with Sri Aurobindo Blue Plaque.JPG|thumb|250px|upright| Basement of 49 St Stephen's Avenue, London W12 with Sri Aurobindo [[Blue Plaque]]]]
Drewett emigrated to Australia in 1884, causing the boys to be uprooted as they went to live with Drewett's mother in London. In September of that year, Aurobindo and Manmohan joined [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]] there.{{efn|Benoybhusan's education ended in Manchester.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=19|ps=}}}} He learned Greek and spent the last three years reading literature and English poetry. He also acquired some familiarity with the German and Italian languages and, exposed to the evangelical strictures of Drewett's mother, a distaste for religion. He considered himself at one point to be an atheist but later determined that he was agnostic.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|pp=14–18|ps=}} A [[blue plaque]] unveiled in 2007 commemorates Aurobindo's residence at 49 St Stephen's Avenue in [[Shepherd's Bush]], London, from 1884 to 1887.{{sfn|English Heritage|ps=}} The three brothers began living in spartan circumstances at the Liberal Club in [[South Kensington]] during 1887, their father having experienced some financial difficulties. The Club's secretary was James Cotton, brother of their father's friend in the Bengal ICS, [[Henry John Stedman Cotton|Henry Cotton]].{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=18|ps=}}

By 1889, Manmohan had determined to pursue a literary career and Benoybhusan had proved himself unequal to the standards necessary for ICS entrance. This meant that only Aurobindo might fulfil his father's aspirations but to do so when his father lacked money required that he studied hard for a scholarship.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=19|ps=}} To become an ICS official, students were required to pass the competitive examination, as well as to study at an English university for two years under probation. Aurobindo secured a scholarship at King's College, Cambridge, under recommendation of [[Oscar Browning]].{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|pp=29–30|ps=}} He passed the written ICS examination after a few months, being ranked 11th out of 250 competitors. He spent the next two years at King's College.{{sfn|ACAD|GHS890AA}} Aurobindo had no interest in the ICS and came late to the horse-riding practical exam purposefully to get himself disqualified for the service.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=31|ps=}}

At this time, the Maharaja of Baroda, [[Sayajirao Gaekwad III]], was travelling in England. Cotton secured for him a place in Baroda State Service and arranged for him to meet the prince.{{sfnp|Thakur|2004|p=6|ps=}} He left England for India,{{sfnp|Thakur|2004|p=6|ps=}} arriving there in February 1893.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=34|ps=}} In India, Krishna Dhun Ghose, who was waiting to receive his son, was misinformed by his agents from [[Bombay]] (now Mumbai) that the ship on which Aurobindo had been travelling had sunk off the coast of Portugal. His father died upon hearing this news.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=36|ps=}}{{sfnp|Thakur|2004|p=7|ps=}}

=== Baroda and Calcutta (1893–1910) ===
{{main article|Political history of Sri Aurobindo}}
{{See also|Anushilan Samiti}}
In Baroda, Aurobindo joined the state service in 1893, working first in the Survey and Settlements department, later moving to the Department of Revenue and then to the Secretariat, and much miscellaneous work like teaching grammar and assisting in writing speeches for the Maharaja of [[Gaekwad]] until 1897.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=37|ps=}} In 1897 during his work in Baroda he started working as a part-time French teacher at [[Baroda College]] (now Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda). He was later promoted to the post of vice-principal.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=42|ps=}} At Baroda, Aurobindo self-studied [[Sanskrit]] and [[Bengali (language)|Bengali]].{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=43|ps=}}
[[File:Bande mataram.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Copy of ''Bande Mataram'', September 1907]]
During his stay at Baroda he contributed to many articles to ''Indu Prakash'' and spoke as a chairman of the Baroda college board.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=68|ps=}} He started taking an active interest in the politics of India's independence struggle against British rule, working behind the scenes as his position in the Baroda state administration barred him from overt political activity. He linked up with resistance groups in Bengal and [[Madhya Pradesh]], while traveling to these states. He established contact with [[Lokmanya Tilak]] and [[Sister Nivedita]]. He arranged the military training of Jatindra Nath Banerjee ([[Niralamba Swami]]) in the Baroda army and then dispatched him to organise the resistance groups in Bengal.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=77|ps=}}

Aurobindo often traveled between Baroda and Bengal, at first in a bid to re-establish links with his parent's families and other Bengali relatives, including his sister Sarojini and brother Barin, and later increasingly to establish resistance groups across the Presidency. He formally moved to Calcutta in 1906 after the announcement of the [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|Partition of Bengal]]. Age 28, he had married 14-year-old Mrinalini, daughter of Bhupal Chandra Bose, a senior official in government service, when he visited Calcutta in 1901. Mrinalini died in December 1918 during the [[1918 flu pandemic|influenza pandemic]].{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=53|ps=}}

Aurobindo was influenced by studies on rebellion and revolutions against England in medieval France and the revolts in America and Italy. In his public activities he favoured [[Non-cooperation movement|non-co-operation]] and passive resistance; in private he took up secret revolutionary activity as a preparation for open revolt, in case that the passive revolt failed.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=71|ps=}}
[[File:Sri Aurobindo presiding over a meeting of the Nationalists after the Surat Congress, with Tilak speaking, 1907.jpg|thumb|upright|Right|Sri Aurobindo seated at the table, with [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak|Tilak]] speaking: Surat session of congress, 1907]]
In Bengal, with Barin's help, he established contacts with revolutionaries, inspiring radicals such as [[Bagha Jatin]], Jatin Banerjee and Surendranath Tagore. He helped establish a series of youth clubs, including the [[Anushilan Samiti]] of Calcutta in 1902.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=67|ps=}}

Aurobindo attended the 1906 [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] meeting headed by [[Dadabhai Naoroji]] and participated as a councillor in forming the fourfold objectives of "Swaraj, Swadesh, Boycott and national education". In 1907 at the Surat session of Congress where moderates and extremists had a major showdown, he led with extremists along with [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]]. The Congress split after this session.{{sfnp|Thorpe|2010|p=29|ps=C}} In 1907–1908 Aurobindo traveled extensively to [[Pune]], Bombay and Baroda to firm up support for the nationalist cause, giving speeches and meeting with groups. He was arrested again in May 1908 in connection with the [[Alipore Bomb Case]]. He was acquitted in the ensuing trial, following the murder of chief prosecution witness Naren Gosain within jail premises which subsequently led to the case against him collapsing. Aurobindo was subsequently released after a year of isolated incarceration.

Once out of the prison he started two new publications, ''Karmayogin'' in English and ''Dharma'' in Bengali. He also delivered the [[s:Uttarpara Speech|Uttarpara Speech]] hinting at the transformation of his focus to spiritual matters. The British persecution continued because of his writings in his new journals and in April 1910 Aurobindo moved to Pondicherry, where Britain's [[secret police]] monitored his activities.{{sfnp|Lorenzo|1999|p=70|ps=}}{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=217|ps=}}

=== Conversion from politics to spirituality ===
[[File:Aurobindo jail picture.JPG|thumb|upright|225px|left| Photographs of Aurobindo
as a prisoner in [[Alipore Jail]], 1908.]]
In July 1905 then [[Viceroy of India]], [[Lord Curzon]], partitioned Bengal. This sparked an outburst of public anger against the British, leading to civil unrest and a nationalist campaign by groups of revolutionaries, who included Aurobindo. In 1908, [[Khudiram Bose]] and [[Prafulla Chaki]] attempted to kill Magistrate Kingsford, a judge known for handing down particularly severe sentences against nationalists. However, the bomb thrown at his horse carriage missed its target and instead landed in another carriage and killed two British women, the wife and daughter of barrister [[Pringle Kennedy]]. Aurobindo was also arrested on charges of planning and overseeing the attack and imprisoned in solitary confinement in [[Alipore Jail]]. The trial of the Alipore Bomb Case lasted for a year, but eventually he was acquitted on May 6, 1909. His defence counsel was [[Chittaranjan Das]].{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=86|ps=}}

During this period in the Jail, his view of life was radically changed due to spiritual experiences and realizations. Consequently, his aim went far beyond the service and liberation of the country. {{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=61|ps=}}

Aurobindo said he was "visited" by [[Vivekananda]] in the Alipore Jail: "It is a fact that I was hearing constantly the voice of Vivekananda speaking to me for a fortnight in the jail in my solitary meditation and felt his presence."{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=98|ps=}}

In his autobiographical notes, Aurobindo said he felt a vast sense of calmness when he first came back to India. He could not explain this and continued to have various such experiences from time to time. He knew nothing of yoga at that time and started his practise of it without a teacher, except for some rules that he learned from Ganganath, a friend who was a disciple of [[Brahmananda]].{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=110|ps=}} <!--When Sri Aurobindo became involved with Congress and ''Vande Mataram'', Barin had continued to meet patriotic youngsters for recruitment for such a plan.{{clarify|reason=what plan?}}--> In 1907, Barin introduced Aurobindo to [[Vishnu Bhaskar Lele]], a Maharashtrian yogi. Aurobindo was influenced by the guidance he got from the yogi, who had instructed Aurobindo to depend on an inner guide and any kind of external guru or guidance would not be required.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|pp=142–143|ps=}}

In 1910 Aurobindo withdrew himself from all political activities and went into hiding at [[Chandannagar]] in the house of [[Motilal Roy]], while the British were trying to prosecute him for sedition on the basis of a signed article titled 'To My Countrymen', published in ''Karmayogin''. As Aurobindo disappeared from view, the warrant was held back and the prosecution postponed. Aurobindo manoeuvred the police into open action and a warrant was issued on 4 April 1910, but the warrant could not be executed because on that date he had reached Pondicherry, then a [[French colony]].{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=101|ps=}} The warrant against Aurobindo was withdrawn.

=== Pondicherry (1910–1950) ===
In Pondicherry, Aurobindo dedicated himself to his spiritual and philosophical pursuits. In 1914, after four years of secluded yoga, he started a monthly philosophical magazine called ''[[Arya (journal)|Arya]]''. This ceased publication in 1921. Many years later, he revised some of these works before they were published in book form. Some of the book series derived out of this publication were ''The Life Divine'', ''The Synthesis of Yoga'', ''Essays on The Gita'', ''The Secret of The Veda'', ''Hymns to the Mystic Fire'', ''The Upanishads'', ''The Renaissance in India'', ''War and Self-determination'', ''The Human Cycle'', ''The Ideal of Human Unity'' and ''The Future Poetry'' were published in this magazine.{{sfnp|Thakur|2004|pp=31–33|ps=}}

At the beginning of his stay at Pondicherry, there were few followers, but with time their numbers grew, resulting in the formation of the [[Sri Aurobindo Ashram]] in 1926.<ref name="Sketch">{{citation |title=Sri Aurobindo: A Life Sketch |series=Sri Aurobindo Birth Centenary Library |volume=30 |url=http://www.sriaurobindoashram.org/ashram/sriauro/life_sketch.php |accessdate=1 January 2013 }}</ref> From 1926 he started to sign himself as ''Sri Aurobindo'', ''[[Sri]]'' (meaning holy in Sanskrit) being commonly used as an [[honorific]].{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=347|ps=: Sri Aurobindo without the surname seems to have first appeared in print in articles published in Chandernagore in 1920. It did not catch on at that time. He first signed his name Sri Aurobindo in March 1926, but continued to use Sri Aurobindo Ghose for a year or two.}}
[[File:Aurobindodeath.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Sri Aurobindo on his deathbed December 5, 1950]]
For some time afterwards, his main literary output was his voluminous correspondence with his disciples. His letters, most of which were written in the 1930s, numbered in the several thousands. Many were brief comments made in the margins of his disciple's notebooks in answer to their questions and reports of their spiritual practice—others extended to several pages of carefully composed explanations of practical aspects of his teachings. These were later collected and published in book form in three volumes of ''[[Letters on Yoga]].'' In the late 1930s, he resumed work on a poem he had started earlier—he continued to expand and revise this poem for the rest of his life.{{sfnp|Thakur|2004|pp=20–26|ps=}} It became perhaps his greatest literary achievement, ''[[Savitri (book)|Savitri]]'', an epic spiritual poem in [[blank verse]] of approximately 24,000 lines.{{sfnp|Yadav|2007|p=31|ps=: "the fame of Sri Aurobindo mainly rests upon Savitri which is considered as his magnum opus&nbsp;... [It is] a 24000 line blank verse epic in which he has widened the original legend of the Mahabharta and turned it into a symbol where the soul of man, represented by Satyavan, is delivered from the grip of death and ignorance through the love and power of the Divine Mother, incarnated upon earth as Savitri."}}

Aurobindo died on 5 December 1950. Around 60,000 people attended to see his body resting peacefully. Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], and President [[Rajendra Prasad]] praised him for his contribution to Yogic philosophy and the independence struggle. National and international newspapers commemorated his death.<ref name=Sketch/>{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|pages= 411–412|chapter=Epilogue|ps=: "On the morning of December 6, 1950 all of the major newspapers of the country announced the passing of Sri Aurobindo&nbsp;... President Rajendra Prasad, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, central and state ministers&nbsp;... recalled his contribution to the struggle for freedom, his philosophical and other writings, and the example of his yogic discipline. Abroad, his death was noted by newspapers in London, Paris and New York. A writer in the Manchester Guardian called him 'the most massive philosophical thinker that modern India has produced.'"}}

=== Mirra Richard and the development of the Ashram ===
[[File:Aurobindoandthemother.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Henri Cartier-Bresson]]'s Photos of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother]]
Aurobindo's close spiritual collaborator, [[Mirra Richard]] (b. Alfassa), came to be known as ''The Mother''.<ref>{{cite book  |title= Leap of Perception: The Transforming Power of Your Attention |edition= 1 |year= 2013 |publisher= Atria books |location= New York |isbn= 978-1-58270-390-9 |page= 121 }}</ref> She was a [[French people|French national]], born in [[Paris]] on 21 February 1878. In her 20s she studied [[occultism]] with [[Max Theon]]. Along with her husband, Paul Richard, she went to Pondicherry on 29 March 1914,{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=102|ps=}} and finally settled there in 1920. Aurobindo considered her his spiritual equal and collaborator. After 24 November 1926, when Aurobindo retired into seclusion, he left it to her to plan, build and run the ashram, the community of disciples which had gathered around them. Some time later, when families with children joined the ashram, she established and supervised the [[Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education]] with its experiments in the field of education. When he died in 1950, She continued their spiritual work, directed the ashram, and guided their disciples.{{sfnp|Jones|Ryan|2007|pp=292–293|ps=}}

Sri Aurobindo's concept of the Integral Yoga system is described in his books, ''The Synthesis of Yoga'' and ''The Life Divine''. {{sfnp|McDermott|1994|p=281|ps=}} ''The Life Divine'' is a compilation of essays published serially in ''Arya.''

Sri Aurobindo argues that divine ''[[Brahman]]'' manifests as empirical reality through ''[[līlā]],'' or divine play. Instead of positing that the world we experience is an illusion (''[[Maya (illusion)|māyā]]'')'','' Aurobindo argues that world can evolve and become a new world with new species, far above the human species just as human species have evolved after the animal species.

Sri Aurobindo believed that [[Darwinism]] merely describes a phenomenon of the evolution of matter into life, but does not explain the reason behind it, while he finds life to be already present in matter, because all of existence is a manifestation of ''Brahman''. He argues that nature (which he interpreted as divine) has evolved life out of matter and then mind out of life.  All of existence, he argues, is attempting to manifest to the level of the supermind - that evolution [[teleology|had a purpose]].{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=5|ps=}}  He stated that he found the task of understanding the [[Metaphysics|nature of reality]] arduous and difficult to justify by immediate tangible results.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=7|ps=}}

== Legacy ==
Sri Aurobindo was an [[Indian nationalist movement|Indian nationalist]] but is best known for his philosophy on human evolution and Integral Yoga.{{sfnp|McDermott|1994|p=11|ps=}}

=== Influence ===
His influence has been wide-ranging. In India, [[Shishir Kumar Maitra|S. K. Maitra]], Anilbaran Roy and [[D. P. Chattopadhyaya]] commented on Sri Aurobindo's work. Writers on [[esotericism]] and traditional wisdom, such as [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Paul Brunton]], and [[Rene Guenon]], all saw him as an authentic representative of the Indian spiritual tradition.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=379|ps=}}

[[Haridas Chaudhuri]] and [[Frederic Spiegelberg]]<ref>Haridas Chaudhuri and Frederic Spiegelberg, ''The integral philosophy of Sri Aurobindo: a commemorative symposium'', Allen & Unwin, 1960</ref> were among those who were inspired by Aurobindo, who worked on the newly formed [[American Academy of Asian Studies]] in San Francisco. Soon after, Chaudhuri and his wife Bina established the Cultural Integration Fellowship, from which later emerged the [[California Institute of Integral Studies]].<ref>"From the American Academy of Asian Studies to the California Institute of Integral Studies"[http://www.well.com/~davidu/aaas-ciis.html]</ref>

[[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] was heavily inspired by Satprem's writings about Sri Aurobindo during a week in May 1968, a time at which the composer was undergoing a personal crisis and had found Sri Aurobindo's philosophies were relevant to his feelings. After this experience, Stockhausen's music took a completely different turn, focusing on mysticism, that was to continue until the end of his career.{{sfnp|O'Mahony|2001|ps=}}

[[William Irwin Thompson]] traveled to [[Auroville]] in 1972, where he met "The Mother". Thompson has called Sri Aurobindo's teaching on spirituality a "radical anarchism" and a "post-religious approach" and regards their work as having "...&nbsp;reached back into the Goddess culture of prehistory, and, in Marshall McLuhan's terms, 'culturally retrieved' the archetypes of the shaman and ''la sage femme''...&nbsp;" Thompson also writes that he experienced Shakti, or psychic power coming from The Mother on the night of her death in 1973.<ref>{{cite web|title=Thinking otherwise&nbsp;– From Religion to Post-Religious Spirituality: Conclusion |url=http://www.wildriverreview.com/Column/Thinking-Otherwise/On-Religion/Post-Religious-Spirituality-Conclusion/William-Irwin-Thompson |accessdate=2014-04-13}}</ref>

Sri Aurobindo's ideas about the further evolution of human capabilities influenced the thinking of [[Michael Murphy (author)|Michael Murphy]]&nbsp;– and indirectly, the [[human potential movement]], through Murphy's writings.{{sfnp|Kripal|2007|pp=60–63|ps=}}

The American philosopher [[Ken Wilber]] has called Sri Aurobindo "India's greatest modern philosopher sage"<ref>Ken Wilber, Foreword to A. S. Dalal (ed.), ''A Greater Psychology&nbsp;– An Introduction to the Psychological Thought of Sri Aurobindo'', Tarcher/Putnam, 2000.</ref> and has integrated some of his ideas into his philosophical vision. Wilber's interpretation of Aurobindo has been criticised by [[Rod Hemsell]].<ref>Rod Hemsell, "[http://www.infinityfoundation.com/mandala/i_es/i_es_hemse_wilber.htm Ken Wilber and Sri Aurobindo: A Critical Perspective]" Jan. 2002.</ref> [[New Age]] writer [[Andrew Harvey (religious writer)|Andrew Harvey]] also looks to Aurobindo as a major inspiration.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hidden Journey: A Spiritual Awakening |url=http://www.tricycle.com/reviews/hidden-journey-spiritual-awakening |accessdate=2014-02-06}}</ref>

=== Followers ===
The following authors, disciples and organisations trace their intellectual heritage back to, or have in some measure been influenced by, Sri Aurobindo and The Mother.
*[[Margaret Woodrow Wilson]] (''Nistha'') (1886–1944), daughter of US President [[Woodrow Wilson]], she came to the ashram in 1940 and stayed there until her death.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=wZJMF1LD7PcC&dat=19440214&printsec=frontpage&hl=en | title=Woodrow Wilson Daughter Dead | work=[[The Milwaukee Sentinel]] | date=February 14, 1944 | accessdate=16 November 2015 | pages=1}}</ref>
*[[Nolini Kanta Gupta]] (1889–1983) was one of Sri Aurobindo's senior disciples, and wrote extensively on philosophy, mysticism, and spiritual evolution based on the teaching of Aurobindo and "The Mother".<ref>{{cite book  |title=Sri Aurobindo: A Contemporary Reade |author=Sachidananda Mohanty|edition= 1  |year= 2008 |publisher= routeledge |location= New Delhi |isbn= 978-0-415-46093-4 |page= 36}}</ref>
*[[Pavitra]] (1894–1969) was one of their early disciples. Born as Philippe Barbier Saint-Hilaire in Paris. Pavitra left some very interesting memoirs of his conversations with them in 1925 and 1926, which were published as ''Conversations avec Pavitra''.<ref>{{cite book  |title=Mother's Agenda |author=Satprem|edition= 3 |volume=6 |year= 1965 |publisher= Inst. de Recherches Évolutives |location= Paris |isbn= 0-938710-12-5 |page= 188}}</ref>
*[[Indra Sen]] (1903–1994) was another disciple of Sri Aurobindo who, although little-known in the West, was the first to articulate [[integral psychology]] and integral philosophy, in the 1940s and 1950s. A compilation of his papers came out under the title, ''Integral Psychology'' in 1986.<ref>K. Satchidanandan, ''Who's who of Indian Writers: supplementary volume'', 1990 New Delhi : Sahitya Akademi,, p. 134</ref>
* [[Nirodbaran]] (1903–2006). A doctor who obtained his medical degree from Edinburgh, his long and voluminous correspondence with Sri Aurobindo elaborate on many aspects of Integral Yoga and fastidious record of conversations bring out Sri Aurobindo's thought on numerous subjects.{{sfnp|Nirodbaran|1973|pp=1–19|ps=}}
* [[M. P. Pandit]] (1918–1993). Secretary to "The Mother" and the ashram, his copious writings and lectures cover Yoga, the Vedas, Tantra, Sri Aubindo's epic "Savitri" and others.
*[[Chinmoy]] (1931–2007) joined the ashram in 1944. Later, he wrote the play about Sri Aurobindo's life – ''Sri Aurobindo: Descent of the Blue'' – and a book, ''Infinite: Sri Aurobindo''.<ref>{{Citation |last=Sri |first=Chinmoy |title=Sri Chinmoy's writings on Sri Aurobindo |url=http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/spiritual/sri_aurobindo |accessdate=12 November 2013 }}</ref> An author, composer, artist and athlete, he was perhaps best known for holding public events on the theme of inner peace and world harmony (such as concerts, meditations, and races).{{sfnp|Dua|2005|pp=18–22|ps=}}
*[[Satprem]] (1923–2007) was a French author and an important disciple of "The Mother" who published [[Mother's Agenda|''Mother's Agenda (1982)'']], ''Sri Aurobindo or the Adventure of Consciousness'' (2000), ''On the Way to Supermanhood'' (2002) and more.{{sfnp|Satprem|1982|p=5|ps=}}

=== Critics ===
*[[N. R. Malkani]] finds Aurobindo's theory of creation to be false, as the theory talks about experiences and visions which are beyond normal human experiences. He says the theory is an intellectual response to a difficult problem and that Aurobindo uses the trait of unpredictability in theorising and discussing things not based upon truth of existence. Malkani says that awareness is already a reality and suggests there would be no need to examine the creative activity subjected to awareness.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sri Aurobindo's theory of evolution&nbsp;– a criticism by Prof. Malkani examined |url=http://www.drkcv.org/Books/kcv4chap_6.htm |accessdate=2014-02-06}}</ref>
*[[Ken Wilber|Wilber's]] interpretation of Aurobindo's philosophy differed from the notion of dividing reality as a different level of matter, life, mind, overmind, supermind proposed by Aurobindo in ''The Life Divine'', and terms them as higher- or lower-nested [[holon (philosophy)|holons]] and states that there is only a fourfold reality (a system of reality created by himself).<ref>{{cite web |title=Wilber's Critique of Sri Aurobindo |url=http://www.kheper.net/topics/Wilber/Wilber_on_Aurobindo.html |accessdate=2014-10-13}}</ref>
*[[Adi Da]] finds that Aurobindo's contributions were merely literary and cultural and had extended his political motivation into spirituality and human evolution <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beezone.com/DawnHorse/aurobindo.htm|title=Bubba Free John in India |work= The Dawn Horse Magazine|date=4 August 1974|accessdate=6 March 2014}}</ref>
*[[Rajneesh]] (Osho) says that Aurobindo was a great scholar but was never realised; that his personal ego had made him indirectly claim that he went beyond [[Buddha]]; and that he is said to have believed himself to be enlightened due to increasing number of followers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oshosearch.net/Convert/Articles_Osho/Beyond_Enlightenment/Osho-Beyond-Enlightenment-00000017.html |title=Osho Beyond Enlightenment |work= Beyond Enlightenment |accessdate=6 March 2014}}</ref>
