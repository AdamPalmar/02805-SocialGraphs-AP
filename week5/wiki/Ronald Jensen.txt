'''Ronald Björn Jensen''' (born April 1, 1936) is an [[United States|American]] [[mathematician]] active in [[Europe]], primarily known for his work in [[mathematical logic]] and [[set theory]].

==Career==
Jensen completed the BA in [[economics]] at [[American University]] in 1959, and a Ph.D. in [[mathematics]] at the [[University of Bonn]] in 1964. His supervisor was [[Gisbert Hasenjaeger]]. Jensen taught at [[Rockefeller University]], 1969–71, and the [[University of California, Berkeley]], 1971-73. The balance of his academic career was spent in Europe at the
[[University of Bonn]], the [[University of Oslo]], the [[Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg|University of Freiburg]], the [[University of Oxford]], and the [[Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin]], from which he retired in 2001. He now resides in [[Berlin]].

In 2015 the European Set Theory Society awarded him and [[John R. Steel]] the ''Hausdorff medal'' for their paper "K without the measurable".

==Results==
Jensen's better-known results include the:
* [[Axiomatic set theory]] [[New Foundations|NFU]], a variant of [[New Foundations]] (NF) where extensionality is weakened to allow several sets with no elements, and the proof of NFU's [[consistency]] relative to [[Peano arithmetic]];
* Fine structure theory of the [[constructible universe]] '''L'''. This work led to his being awarded in 2003 the [[Leroy P Steele Prize|Leroy P. Steele Prize for Seminal Contribution to Research]] of the [[American Mathematical Society]] for his 1972 paper titled "The fine structure of the constructible hierarchy";
*Definitions and proofs of various [[Infinitary combinatorics|infinitary combinatorial principle]]s in '''L''', including [[diamondsuit|diamond]] <math>\diamondsuit</math>, [[global square|square]], and [[morass (set theory)|morass]];
* [[Jensen's covering theorem]] for '''L''';
* General theory of [[core model]]s and the construction of the [[Dodd–Jensen core model]];
* Consistency of CH plus [[Suslin's hypothesis]].
* Technique of [[coding the universe by a real]].
