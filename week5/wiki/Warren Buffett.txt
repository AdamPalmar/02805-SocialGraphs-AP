Born in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], Buffett developed an interest in business and investing in his youth, eventually entering the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton School]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1947 before transferring and graduating from [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln]] at the age of 19. Buffett went on to enroll and graduate from [[Columbia Business School|Columbia University]] where he learned and eventually molded his investment philosophy around a concept pioneered by [[Benjamin Graham]]–[[value investing]]. He attended [[New York Institute of Finance]] to specialize his economics background and soon after began various business partnerships, including one with Graham. After meeting [[Charlie Munger]], Buffett created the Buffett Partnership. His firm would eventually acquire a textile manufacturing firm called [[Berkshire Hathaway]] and assume its name to create a diversified holding company.

==Early life and education==
Buffett was born in 1930 in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], the second of three children and the only son of Leila (née Stahl) and Congressman [[Howard Buffett]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Blair |first=Elliot |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/2004-01-29-nebraska_x.htm |title=Nebraska family clashes over love, money and death |work=USA Today  |date=January 29, 2004 |accessdate=May 23, 2010}}</ref> Buffett began his education at Rose Hill Elementary School.

Buffett displayed an interest in business and investing at a young age. He was inspired by a book he borrowed from the Omaha public library at the age of seven, ''[[One Thousand Ways to Make $1000]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Levere|first1=Jane|title=New HBO Documentary On Warren Buffett Uses Family Photos, Home Movies To Reveal His Life Story|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/janelevere/2017/01/30/new-hbo-documentary-on-warren-buffett-uses-family-photos-home-movies-to-reveal-his-life-story/|accessdate=July 7, 2017|work=Forbes|date=January 30, 2017|quote=A voracious reader his entire life, at age seven he read a book he borrowed from the library, One Thousand Ways to Make $1000, and, inspired by its lessons, began selling Coca-Cola, gum and newspapers.}}</ref> Much of Buffett's early childhood years were enlivened with entrepreneurial ventures. One of his first business ventures, Buffett sold chewing gum, [[Coca-Cola]] bottles, or weekly magazines [[door to door]]. He worked in his grandfather's grocery store. While still in high school, he made money delivering newspapers, selling golf balls and stamps, and detailing cars, among other means. On his first income [[Tax return (United States)|tax return]] in 1944, Buffett took a $35 deduction for the use of his bicycle and watch on his paper route.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7280569.stm|title=Buffett 'becomes world's richest'|accessdate=May 20, 2008|publisher=BBC  | date=March 6, 2008}}</ref> In 1945, as a high school sophomore, Buffett and a friend spent $25 to purchase a used [[pinball]] machine, which they placed in the local [[barber|barber shop]].

Buffett's interest in the stock market and investing dated to schoolboy days he spent in the customers' lounge of a regional [[brokerage firm|stock brokerage]] near his father's own brokerage office. On a trip to New York City at age ten, he made a point to visit the [[New York Stock Exchange]]. At 11, he bought three shares of [[Cities Service]] Preferred for himself, and three for his sister Doris Buffett (founder of The Sunshine Lady Foundation).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/Latest-News-Wires/2014/0527/Doris-Buffett-works-one-on-one-to-help-with-billionaire-brother-s-charity |title=Doris Buffett works one-on-one to help with billionaire brother's charity, May&nbsp;27, 2014 |work=The Christian Science Monitor |accessdate=January 4, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fool.com/specials/1999/sp990429Berkshire002.htm |title=Special Feature, April&nbsp;29, 1999: Berkshire and Buffett |publisher=Fool.com |accessdate=November 28, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=OOZWykmT-KUC&pg=PA26| title=Warren Buffett wealth: principles and practical methods used by the world's greatest investor| author=Robert P.

In high school, he invested in a business owned by his father and bought a 40-acre farm worked by a tenant farmer. He bought the land when he was 14 years old with $1,200 of his savings. By the time he finished college, Buffett had accumulated $9,800 in savings (about ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|9800|1949|r=-3}}}} today).<ref name="Warren Buffett Timeline"/>{{Inflation-fn|US}}

In 1947, Buffett entered the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton School]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. He would have preferred to focus on his business ventures; however, he enrolled due to pressure from his father.<ref name="Warren Buffett Timeline"/> Warren studied there for two years and joined the [[Alpha Sigma Phi]] fraternity.<ref>[http://www.thedp.com/article/2012/09/alpha-sigma-phi-comes-back-to-penn], The Daily Pennsylvanian.</ref> He then transferred to the [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln]] where at 19, he graduated with a [[Bachelor of Science]] in [[Business Administration]]. After being rejected by [[Harvard Business School]], Buffett enrolled at [[Columbia Business School]] of [[Columbia University]] upon learning that [[Benjamin Graham]] taught there. He earned a [[Master of Science]] in [[Economics]] from Columbia in 1951. After graduating, Buffett attended the [[New York Institute of Finance]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.warrenbuffett.com/history/|title=History|publisher=warrenbuffett.com|access-date=December 13, 2016}}</ref>

==Investment career==
{{Details|topic=Warren Buffett's time at Berkshire Hathaway|List of assets owned by Berkshire Hathaway||}}

===Early business career===
Buffett worked from 1951 to 1954 at Buffett-Falk & Co. as an investment salesman; from 1954 to 1956 at Graham-Newman Corp. as a securities analyst; from 1956 to 1969 at Buffett Partnership, Ltd. as a general partner and from 1970, as [[Chair (official)|Chairman]] and CEO of [[Berkshire Hathaway|Berkshire Hathaway Inc]].

In April 1952, Buffett discovered that [[Benjamin Graham|Graham]] was on the board of [[GEICO]] insurance. Taking a train to Washington, D.C. on a Saturday, he knocked on the door of GEICO's headquarters until a janitor admitted him. There he met Lorimer Davidson, Geico's Vice President, and the two discussed the insurance business for hours. Davidson would eventually become Buffett's lifelong friend and a lasting influence,<ref>{{cite book|author=Lowenstein, Roger|title=Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist|page=43|isbn=0-385-48491-7}}</ref> and would later recall that he found Buffett to be an "extraordinary man" after only fifteen minutes. Buffett wanted to work on [[Wall Street]]; however, both his father and Ben Graham urged him not to. He offered to work for Graham for free, but Graham refused.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intelligentinvestorclub.com/downloads/Warren-Buffett-Florida-Speech.pdf |title=Lecture at the University of Florida School of Business – Transcript (PDF document) |publisher=Intelligent Investor |date=October 15, 1998|accessdate=May 7, 2010}}</ref>

Buffett returned to Omaha and worked as a stockbroker while taking a [[Dale Carnegie]] public speaking course.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505383_162-57373393/person-to-person-warren-buffett/ | publisher=CBS News | title="Person to Person": Warren Buffett}}</ref> Using what he learned, he felt confident enough to teach an "Investment Principles" night class at the [[University of Nebraska-Omaha]]. The average age of his students was more than twice his own. During this time he also purchased a Sinclair Texaco gas station as a side investment. However, this was not successful.<ref>{{cite book | first=Alice | last=Schroeder | authorlink=Alice Schroeder | title=The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life | page=169 | publisher=Bantam Dell | date=2008 | isbn=978-0-553-80509-3}}</ref>

 }}</ref> Buffett married [[Susan Buffett|Susan Thompson]] at Dundee Presbyterian Church. The next year they had their first child, [[Susan Alice Buffett|Susan Alice]]. In 1954, Buffett accepted a job at [[Benjamin Graham]]'s partnership. His starting salary was $12,000 a year (about ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|12000|1954|r=-3}}}} today).{{Inflation-fn|US}} There he worked closely with [[Walter Schloss]]. Graham was a tough boss. He was adamant that stocks provide a wide margin of safety after weighing the trade-off between their price and their intrinsic value. The argument made sense to Buffett but he questioned whether the criteria were too stringent and caused the company to miss out on big winners that had other appealing features.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} That same year the Buffetts had their second child, [[Howard Graham Buffett|Howard Graham]]. In 1956, Benjamin Graham retired and closed his partnership. At this time Buffett's personal savings were over $174,000 (about ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|0.174|1956|r=2}}}} million today){{Inflation-fn|US}} and he started Buffett Partnership Ltd.

[[File:Dundee HD Omaha NE.JPG|thumb|Buffett's home in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]]]
In 1957, Buffett operated three partnerships. He purchased a five-bedroom stucco house in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], where he still lives, for $31,500.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mmk45fgld/warren-buffett-house-omaha-nebraska/|title=Billionaire Houses|website=|access-date=October 20, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/money/3843188/this-is-how-much-it-costs-to-live-next-to-warren-buffett/|title=This Is How Much It Costs to Live Next Door to Warren Buffett|last=Poppick|first=Susie|date=May 1, 2016|work=Time|access-date=October 1, 2016}}</ref> In 1958 the Buffetts' third child, [[Peter Andrew Buffett|Peter Andrew]], was born. Buffett operated five partnerships that year. In 1959, the company grew to six partnerships and Buffett met future partner [[Charlie Munger]]. By 1960, Buffett operated seven partnerships. He asked one of his partners, a doctor, to find ten other doctors willing to invest $10,000 each in his partnership. Eventually eleven agreed, and Buffett pooled their money with a mere $100 original investment of his own. In 1961, Buffett revealed that [[Sanborn Map Company]] accounted for 35% of the partnership's assets. He explained that in 1958 Sanborn stock sold at only $45 per share when the value of the Sanborn investment portfolio was $65 per share. This meant that buyers valued Sanborn stock at "minus $20" per share and were unwilling to pay more than 70 cents on the dollar for an investment portfolio with a map business thrown in for nothing which earned him a spot on Sanborn's board.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.oldschoolvalue.com/blog/investing-perspective/warren-buffett-career-timeline-investments/|title=The Evolution of Warren Buffett's Career from 1936 to 2013|date=October 23, 2013|newspaper=The Value Investing Blog of Old School Value|language=en-US|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref>

===Assuming Berkshire===
In 1962, Buffett became a millionaire because of his partnerships, which in January 1962 had an excess of $7,178,500, of which over $1,025,000 belonged to Buffett. He merged these partnerships into one. Buffett invested in and eventually took control of a textile manufacturing firm, [[Berkshire Hathaway]]. He began buying shares in Berkshire from [[Seabury Stanton]], the owner, whom he later fired. Buffett's partnerships began purchasing shares at $7.60 per share. In 1965, when Buffett's partnerships began purchasing Berkshire aggressively, they paid $14.86 per share while the company had [[working capital]] of $19 per share. This did not include the value of fixed assets (factory and equipment). Buffett took control of Berkshire Hathaway at a board meeting and named a new president, Ken Chace, to run the company. In 1966, Buffett closed the partnership to new money. He later claimed that the textile business had been his worst trade.<ref>{{cite AV media |title=Buffett's Worst Trade | date=October 18, 2010 |url= https://www.cnbc.com/id/39724884 |publisher=CNBC }}</ref> He then moved the business into the insurance sector, and, in 1985, the last of the mills that had been the core business of Berkshire Hathaway was sold. Buffett wrote in his letter: "...&nbsp;unless it appears that circumstances have changed (under some conditions added capital would improve results) or unless new partners can bring some asset to the partnership other than simply capital, I intend to admit no additional partners to BPL."{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In a second letter, Buffett announced his first investment in a private business&nbsp;— Hochschild, Kohn and Co, a privately owned Baltimore department store. In 1967, Berkshire paid out its first and only dividend of 10 cents.<ref name="Kenny2009">{{cite book|author=Graham Kenny|title=Diversification Strategy: How to Grow a Business by Diversifying Successfully|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PRrbeA_e0egC&pg=PA160|date=August 3, 2009|publisher=Kogan Page Publishers|isbn=978-0-7494-5833-1|pages=160}}</ref> In 1969, following his most successful year, Buffett liquidated the partnership and transferred their assets to his partners. Among the assets paid out were shares of Berkshire Hathaway. In 1970, Buffett began writing his now-famous annual letters to shareholders. However, he lived solely on his salary of $50,000 per year and his outside investment income. In 1979, Berkshire began the year trading at $775 per share, and ended at $1,310. Buffett's net worth reached $620&nbsp;million.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In 1973, Berkshire began to acquire stock in the [[Graham Holdings Company|Washington Post Company]]. Buffett became close friends with [[Katharine Graham]], who controlled the company and its flagship newspaper, and joined its board. In 1974, the SEC opened a formal investigation into Buffett and Berkshire's acquisition of [[Wesco Financial]], due to possible conflict of interest. No charges were brought. In 1977, Berkshire [[List of Berkshire Hathaway publications|indirectly purchased]] the ''[[Buffalo Evening News]]'' for $32.5&nbsp;million. Antitrust charges started, instigated by its rival, the ''[[Buffalo Courier-Express]]''. Both papers lost money, until the ''Courier-Express'' folded in 1982.

In 1979, Berkshire began to acquire stock in ABC. [[Capital Cities Communications|Capital Cities]] announced a $3.5&nbsp;billion purchase of ABC on March 18, 1985 surprising the media industry, as ABC was four times bigger than Capital Cities at the time. Buffett helped finance the deal in return for a 25% stake in the combined company.<ref>Kleinfield, N.R. "ABC is being sold for $3.5&nbsp;billion; 1st network sale". ''The New York Times'', March 19, 1985.</ref> The newly merged company, known as Capital Cities/ABC (or CapCities/ABC), was forced to sell some stations due to [[U.S. Federal Communications Commission]] ownership rules. The two companies also owned several radio stations in the same markets.<ref>"FCC approval of Capcities/ABC deal likely". ''[[Broadcasting & Cable|Broadcasting]]'', March 25, 1985.</ref>

In 1987, Berkshire Hathaway purchased a 12% stake in Salomon Inc., making it the largest shareholder and Buffett a director. In 1990, a scandal involving [[John Gutfreund]] (former CEO of [[Salomon Brothers]]) surfaced. A [[rogue trader]], Paul Mozer, was submitting bids in excess of what was allowed by Treasury rules. When this was brought to  Gutfreund's attention, he did not immediately suspend the rogue trader. Gutfreund left the company in August 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mbaa.fuqua.duke.edu/ldi/press_johngutfreund.html |title=''Inaction Can be as Dangerous as Bad Action'', Aly Gonenne, Class of 2004, Duke Leadership Development Initiative |publisher=Mbaa.fuqua.duke.edu |accessdate=May 23, 2010}}</ref> Buffett became Chairman of Salomon until the crisis passed.<ref>[http://www.c-spanarchives.org/library/index.php?main_page=product_video_info&products_id=21029-1 Redirecting<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308182509/http://www.c-spanarchives.org/library/index.php?main_page=product_video_info&products_id=21029-1 |date=March 8, 2012 }}</ref>

During a 2005 investigation of an accounting fraud case involving AIG, Gen Re executives became implicated.

In 2002, Buffett entered in US$11&nbsp;billion worth of [[forward contract]]s to deliver U.S. dollars against other currencies. By April 2006, his total gain on these contracts was over US$2&nbsp;billion. In 2006, Buffett announced in June that he gradually would give away 85% of his Berkshire holdings to five foundations in annual gifts of stock, starting in July 2006—the largest contribution would go to the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]].<ref>{{cite journal|first=Carol J.|last=Loomis|title=Warren Buffett gives away his fortune|journal=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]|date=June 25, 2006|ref=harv}}</ref>

===2007-08 financial crisis===

In addition to suggestions of mistiming, the wisdom in keeping some of Berkshire's major holdings, including The Coca-Cola Company, which in 1998 peaked at $86, raised questions. Buffett discussed the difficulties of knowing when to sell in the company's 2004 annual report:
<blockquote>
That may seem easy to do when one looks through an always-clean, rear-view mirror. Unfortunately, however, it's the windshield through which investors must peer, and that glass is invariably fogged.<ref>Schroeder, Alice ''The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life'' {{ISBN|0-553-80509-6}} Bantam Sept 2008</ref>
</blockquote>
In March 2009, Buffett said in a cable television interview that the economy had "fallen off a cliff ... Not only has the economy slowed down a lot, but people have really changed their habits like I haven't seen". Additionally, Buffett feared that inflation levels that occurred in the 1970s—which led to years of painful [[stagflation]]—might re-emerge.<ref>Josh Funk, [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2008830635_apbuffetteconomy.html "Buffett says nation will face higher unemployment"], [[Associated Press|AP]] on [[Seattle Times]], March 9, 2009.

On August 14, 2014, the price of Berkshire Hathaway's shares hit US$200,000 a share for the first time, capitalizing the company at US$328 billion. While Buffett had given away much of his stock to charities by this time, he still held 321,000 shares worth US$64.2 billion. On August 20, 2014, Berkshire Hathaway was fined $896,000 for failing to report December 9, 2013 purchase of shares in [[USG Corporation]] as required.<ref>Stempel, Jonathan (August 20, 2014) [https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/20/berkshirehathaway-settlement-idUSL2N0QQ1LR20140820 UPDATE 3-U.S. fines Berkshire over stock deal, Buffett admits mistake].

I in no way anticipated the dramatic fall in energy prices that occurred in the last half of the year. I still believe the odds are good that oil sells far higher in the future than the current $40–$50 price. But so far I have been dead wrong.

In November 2011, it was announced that over the course of the previous eight months, Buffett had bought 64 million shares of [[International Business Machine]] Corp (IBM) stock, worth around $11 billion. This unanticipated investment raised his stake in the company to around 5.5 percent—the largest stake in IBM alongside that of [[State Street Global Advisors]]. Buffett had said on numerous prior occasions that he would not invest in technology because he did not fully understand it, so the move came as a surprise to many investors and observers. During the interview, in which he revealed the investment to the public, Buffett stated that he was impressed by the company's ability to retain corporate clients and said, "I don't know of any large company that really has been as specific on what they intend to do and how they intend to do it as IBM."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/14/us-buffett-ibm-idUSTRE7AD0V720111114 |title=Buffett sheds tech aversion with big IBM investment |date=November 14, 2011 | agency=Reuters}}</ref>

Interim publisher James W.

The ''Press of Atlantic City'' became Berkshire's 30th daily newspaper, following other purchases such as Virginia, U.S.' ''Roanoke Times'' and ''The Tulsa World'' in Oklahoma, U.S.<ref>{{cite news |title=Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway bets on Atlantic City |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/100896864 |accessdate=September 20, 2013 |work=CNBC News |date=July 18, 2013 |first=Alex |last=Crippen}}</ref>

During a presentation to [[Georgetown University]] students in [[Washington, D.C.]] in late September 2013, Buffett compared the U.S. Federal Reserve to a hedge fund and stated that the bank is generating "$80 billion or $90 billion a year probably" in revenue for the U.S. government. Buffett also advocated further on the issue of wealth equality in society:

<blockquote>
We have learned to turn out lots of goods and services, but we haven’t learned as well how to have everybody share in the bounty. The obligation of a society as prosperous as ours is to figure out how nobody gets left too far behind.<ref>{{cite news |title=Buffett Calls Federal Reserve History’s Greatest Hedge Fund |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-20/buffett-says-federal-reserve-is-greatest-hedge-fund-in-history.html |accessdate=September 20, 2013 |work=Bloomberg |date=September 20, 2013 |first=Noah |last=Buhayar}}</ref></blockquote>

After the difficulties of the [[Great Recession|economic crisis]], Buffett managed to bring its company back to its pre-recession standards: in Q2 2014, Berkshire Hathaway made $6.4 billion in net profit, the most it had ever made in a three-month period.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://qz.com/244132/warren-buffetts-firm-just-made-the-most-money-ever-in-a-single-quarter/ |title=Warren Buffett’s firm just made the most money ever in a single quarter |date=August 2, 2014}}</ref>

==Investment philosophy==
Warren Buffett's writings include his annual reports and various articles. Buffett is recognized by communicators<ref>Lou Hoffman, [[The Hoffman Agency]]. "[http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100823075903/http://entrepreneur.venturebeat.com/2010/04/13/startup-lessons-learned-from-warren-buffett/ Startup lessons learned from Warren Buffett]." April 13, 2010. Retrieved, April 16, 2010.</ref> as a great story-teller, as evidenced by his annual letters to shareholders. He warned about the pernicious effects of inflation:<ref>''How Inflation Swindles the Equity Investor'', Warren Buffett, ''Fortune'', May 1977</ref>{{Quote|The arithmetic makes it plain that inflation is a far more devastating tax than anything that has been enacted by our legislatures. The inflation tax has a fantastic ability to simply consume capital. It makes no difference to a widow with her savings in a 5 percent passbook account whether she pays 100 percent income tax on her interest income during a period of zero inflation, or pays no income taxes during years of 5 percent inflation.|Buffett|Fortune (1977)}}

In his article "[[The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville]]", Buffett rebutted the academic [[efficient-market hypothesis]], that beating the [[S&P 500]] was "pure chance", by highlighting the results achieved by a number of students of the Graham and Dodd [[value investing]] school of thought. In addition to himself, Buffett named [[Walter J. Schloss]], Tom Knapp, Ed Anderson ([[Tweedy, Browne|Tweedy, Browne LLC]]), [[William J. Ruane]] ([[Sequoia Fund]], Inc.), [[Charles Munger]] (Buffett's own business partner at Berkshire), Rick Guerin (Pacific Partners, Ltd.), and Stan Perlmeter (Perlmeter Investments).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/12/official-buffett-biography-to-hit-shelves/|title=Official Buffett Biography to Hit Shelves|date=August 12, 2008|work=The New York Times|accessdate=August 15, 2008}}</ref> In his November 1999 ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' article, he warned of investors' unrealistic expectations:<ref>{{cite journal|date=November 22, 1999|title=Mr. Buffett on the Stock Market|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1999/11/22/269071/index.htm|ref=harv|work=Fortune|author=Warren Buffett; [[Carol Loomis]]}}</ref>

{{Quote|Let me summarize what I've been saying about the stock market: I think it's very hard to come up with a persuasive case that equities will over the next 17 years perform anything like—anything like—they've performed in the past 17.

===Index funds and active management===
Towards his later life, particularly following the global financial crisis of 2007-08, Buffett became an increasingly vocal critic of active management, i.e., [[mutual fund]]s and [[hedge fund]]s. Buffett is skeptical that active management and stock-picking can outperform the market in the long run, and has advised both individual and institutional investors to move their money to low-cost index funds that track broad, diversified stock market indices. Buffett said in one of his letters to shareholders that "when trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it will usually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients."<ref name="guardian">{{cite news|title=Warren Buffett, 'Oracle of Omaha', criticizes Wall Street and praises immigrants|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/25/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-wall-street-apple-annual-letter|work=Reuters via the Guardian|date=February 25, 2017}}</ref> In 2007, Buffett made a bet with numerous managers that a simple [[S&P 500]] index fund will outperform hedge funds that charge exorbitant fees.

==Personal life==
[[File:Storm Chasers press conference.jpg|thumb|Buffett with [[Gary Green (baseball owner)|Gary Green]] in 2010]]
In 1949, Buffett was infatuated with a young woman whose current boyfriend had a ukulele.  In an attempt to compete, he bought one of the diminutive instruments and has been playing it ever since. Though the attempt was unsuccessful, his music interest was a key part of his becoming a part of Susan Thompson's life and led to their marriage. Buffett often plays the instrument at stock holder meetings and other opportunities.

In addition to political contributions over the years, Buffett endorsed and made campaign contributions to [[Barack Obama]]'s [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|presidential campaign]]. On July 2, 2008, Buffett attended a $28,500 per plate fundraiser for Obama's campaign in Chicago.<ref>{{cite news

===Taxes===
{{See also|Buffett Rule}}
Buffett stated that he only paid 19% of his income for 2006 ($48.1&nbsp;million) in total federal taxes (due to their source as dividends and capital gains, although the figure excluded the taxes on that income paid by the corporations that provided it), while his employees paid 33% of theirs, despite making much less money.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Forbes]]|date=November 26, 2007|pages=24, 42–3|title=Warren Buffett|ref=harv}}</ref> “How can this be fair?” Buffett asked, regarding how little he pays in taxes compared to his employees.

Buffett favors the [[inheritance tax]], saying that repealing it would be like "choosing the 2020 Olympic team by picking the eldest sons of the gold-medal winners in the 2000 Olympics".<ref>{{cite news|accessdate=May 20, 2008| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1170874.stm| title=Rich Americans back inheritance tax|publisher=BBC |date=February 14, 2001}}</ref> In 2007, Buffett testified before the Senate and urged them to preserve the [[Estate tax in the United States|estate tax]] so as to avoid a [[plutocracy]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://thehill.com/business--lobby/buffett-tells-senate-finance-panel-dynastic-wealth-on-the-rise-in-u.s.-2007-11-15.html |title=Buffett tells Senate Finance panel 'dynastic' wealth on the rise in U.S. |author=Jim Snyder |date=November 15, 2007 |work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120013350/http://thehill.com/business--lobby/buffett-tells-senate-finance-panel-dynastic-wealth-on-the-rise-in-u.s.-2007-11-15.html |archivedate=November 20, 2007 |df= }}</ref> Some critics argued that Buffett (through Berkshire Hathaway) has a personal interest in the continuation of the estate tax, since Berkshire Hathaway benefited from the estate tax in past business dealings and had developed and marketed insurance policies to protect policy holders against future estate tax payments.<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/211907/buffetted-john-berlau| title=Buffetted.

===Trade deficit===
Buffett viewed the United States' expanding [[trade deficit]] as a trend that will devalue the US dollar and US assets. He predicted that the US dollar will lose value in the long run, as a result of putting a larger portion of ownership of US assets in the hands of foreigners. In his letter to shareholders in March 2005, he predicted that in another ten years' time the net ownership of the U.S. by outsiders would amount to $11 [[Trillion (short scale)|trillion]]. <blockquote>Americans&nbsp;... would chafe at the idea of perpetually paying tribute to their creditors and owners abroad. A country that is now aspiring to an '[[ownership society]]' will not find happiness in – and I'll use hyperbole here for emphasis&nbsp;– a '[[sharecropping|sharecropping society]]’.</blockquote>

===Dollar and gold===
The trade deficit induced Buffett to enter the foreign currency market for the first time in 2002. He substantially reduced his stake in 2005 as changing interest rates increased the costs of holding currency contracts. Buffett remained [[Bear market|bearish]] on the dollar, stating that he was looking to acquire companies with substantial foreign revenues. Buffett emphasized the non-productive aspect of a [[gold standard]] for the United States dollar in 1998 at Harvard: <blockquote>It gets dug out of the ground in Africa, or someplace. Then we melt it down, dig another hole, bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it. It has no utility. Anyone watching from Mars would be scratching their head.</blockquote> In 1977, about stocks, gold, farmland and inflation, he stated:<blockquote>Stocks are probably still the best of all the poor alternatives in an era of inflation – at least they are if you buy in at appropriate prices.<ref>{{Cite journal | last=Buffett | first=Warren | title=How Inflation Swindles the Equity Investor | journal=Fortune | date=May 1977 | ref=harv | postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref></blockquote>

===China===
Buffett invested in [[PetroChina]] Company Limited and in a rare move, posted a commentary<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=May 20, 2008|url=http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/sudan.pdf|format=PDF|title=Shareholder Proposal Regarding Berkshire's Investment In PetroChina|publisher=[[Berkshire Hathaway]]}}</ref> on Berkshire Hathaway's website stating why he would not divest over its connection with the [[Second Sudanese Civil War|Sudanese civil war]] that caused Harvard to divest. He sold this stake soon afterwards, sparing him the billions of dollars he would have lost had he held on to the company in the midst of the steep drop in oil prices beginning in the summer of 2008.

In October 2008, Buffett invested $230&nbsp;million for 10% of battery maker [[BYD Company]] ({{Hong Kong Stock Exchange|1211}}), which runs a subsidiary of electric automobile manufacturer [[BYD Auto]]. In less than one year, the investment reaped over 500% return.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=September 16, 2009|url=http://www.chinastakes.com/2009/9/warren-buffets-500-return-from-byd-the-show-just-begun.html|title=Warren Buffett's 500% Return from BYD: The Show Just Begun? |publisher=ChinaStakes}}</ref>

===Tobacco===
During the [[RJR Nabisco]], Inc. hostile takeover fight in 1987, Buffett was quoted as telling [[John Gutfreund]]:<ref>{{cite book | author=Burrough, Bryan; Helyar, John | title=[[Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco]] | publisher=[[Harper & Row]] | location=New York | year=1990 | isbn=0-06-016172-8}}</ref>

===Coal===
In 2007, Buffett's [[PacifiCorp]], a subsidiary of his [[MidAmerican Energy Company]], canceled six proposed coal-fired power plants. These included Utah's [[Intermountain Power Project]] Unit 3, Jim Bridger Unit 5, and four proposed plants previously included in PacifiCorp's Integrated Resource Plan. The cancellations came in the wake of pressure from regulators and citizen groups.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.psc.utah.gov/utilities/electric/07docs/07203501/8-30-07petition.pdf |title=Utah Petition Encouraging Energy Diversification |publisher=[[Public Service Commission of Utah]] |date=July 28, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009121930/http://psc.utah.gov/utilities/electric/07docs/07203501/8-30-07petition.pdf |archivedate=October 9, 2013 |df= }}</ref>

===Renewable energy===
American Indian tribes and salmon fishermen sought to win support from Buffett for a proposal to remove four hydroelectric dams from the [[Klamath River]]. David Sokol responded on Buffett's behalf, stating that the [[FERC]] would decide the question.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/topstories/2008-05-03-3055404993_x.htm|title=Buffett again rebuffs advocates who want Klamath dams out| author=Josh Funk|date=May 3, 2008|work=[[USA Today]]|ref=harv}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Bacher |first=Dan |url=http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2009/05/01/18592169.php |title=Klamath Dam Removal Advocates Call on Buffett’s Company To Close the Deal |publisher=Indybay.org |date=May 1, 2009 |accessdate=May 23, 2010}}</ref>

In December 2011, Buffett's [[MidAmerican Energy]] Holdings agreed to buy a $2 billion [[solar energy]] project under development in California and a 49 percent stake in a $1.8 billion plant in Arizona, his first investments in [[solar power]]. He already owned [[wind farm]]s<nowiki/>.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/print/2011-12-20/bp-to-shut-down-solar-power-unit-exit-business-spokesman-says.html |title=BP Deems Solar Unprofitable, Exiting Business After 40 Years |author=Marc Roca and Ehren Goossens  |date=December 20, 2011 |work=Bloomberg }}</ref>

===Expensing of stock options===
He has been a strong proponent of [[stock option expensing]] on corporate [[Income Statement]]s. At the 2004 annual meeting, he lambasted a bill before the United States Congress that would consider only some company-issued stock options compensation as an expense, likening the bill to one that was almost passed by the [[Indiana House of Representatives]] to [[Indiana Pi Bill|change the value of Pi]] from 3.14159 to 3.2 through legislative fiat.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A29807-2004Jul5.html |title=Warren Buffett, ''Fuzzy Math And Stock Options ''|page =A19 |work=The Washington Post  |date=July 6, 2004 |accessdate=May 23, 2010}}</ref>
<blockquote>When a company gives something of value to its employees in return for their services, it is clearly a compensation expense. And if expenses don't belong in the earnings statement, where in the world do they belong?<ref>{{cite news|last=Buffett |first=Warren E. |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B01EFD81538F937A15754C0A9649C8B63&scp=1&sq=buffett%20cooks%20books&st=cse |title=Warren E. Buffett, ''Who Really Cooks the Books?'' |work=The New York Times |date=July 24, 2002 |accessdate=May 23, 2010}}</ref></blockquote>

===Technology===
In May 2012, Buffett said he had avoided buying stock in new [[social media]] companies such as Facebook and Google because it is hard to estimate future value. He also stated that [[initial public offering]] (IPO) of stock are almost always bad investments. Investors should be looking  to companies that will have good value in ten years.<ref>{{cite news | title = Buffett on Facebook and Google: hard to estimate future valu | date = May 7, 2012 | url = http://www.suntimes.com/business/12373627-420/buffett-on-facebook-and-google-hard-to-estimate-future-value.html | work = Chicago Sun-Times| agency = Associated Press | accessdate = May 7, 2012}}</ref>
