}}'''Yves Marie André ''' (1675–1764), also known as '''le Père André''',  was a French [[Jesuit]] [[mathematician]], [[philosopher]], and [[essayist]].

André entered the Society of Jesus in 1693. Although distinguished in his scholastic studies, he adhered to [[Gallicanism]] and [[Jansenism]] and was thus considered unsuitable for responsible office by Church authorities. He therefore pursued scientific studies and became royal professor of mathematics at Caen.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Yves Marie André}}</ref>

He is best known for his ''Essai sur le Beau'' (''Essay on Beauty''), a 1741 philosophical work on [[aesthetics]], which made him famous at the time and remained a well-known work into the 19th century.<ref>André, ''Essai sur le Beau'' in ''Œuvres Philosophiques'' (Paris: Adolphe Delahays, 1843).</ref>
