'''Lysander Spooner''' (January 19, 1808&nbsp;– May 14, 1887) was an American [[Political philosophy|political philosopher]], [[essay]]ist, [[Pamphleteer|pamphlet writer]], [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]], [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], [[Jurisprudence|legal theorist]], and entrepreneur of the nineteenth century. He was a strong advocate of the labor movement and severely anti-authoritarian and individualist in political views. 

Spooner's most famous writing includes the seminal abolitionist book ''[[The Unconstitutionality of Slavery]]'', and ''[[No Treason: The Constitution of No Authority]]'' which opposed treason charges against secessionists. He is also known for competing with the [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Post Office]] with his [[American Letter Mail Company]], which closed after legal problems with the federal government.

==Life overview==
Spooner was born on a farm in [[Athol, Massachusetts]], on January 19, 1808, and died on May 14, 1887, in [[Boston]].<ref>[[Benjamin Tucker]], "Our Nestor Taken From Us."</ref>

Spooner advocated what he called [[Natural law|Natural Law]]{{spaced ndash}} or the "Science of Justice"{{spaced ndash}} wherein acts of initiatory [[coercion]] against individuals and their property were considered criminal because they were immoral while the so-called criminal acts that violated only man-made (arbitrary) legislation were not necessarily criminal.<ref>Spooner, Lysander, [https://mises.org/journals/lar/pdfs/3_1/3_1_7.pdf Natural Law, or the Science of Justice]</ref>

==Early years==
{{Libertarianism sidebar}}

===Legal career===
Spooner's activism began with his career as a lawyer, which itself violated Massachusetts law.<ref>p. viii, Introduction in The Lysander Spooner Reader, ed. George H. Smith, Fox and Wilkes 1992</ref> Spooner had studied law under the prominent lawyers and politicians [[John Davis (Massachusetts governor)|John Davis]] and [[Charles Allen (Massachusetts politician)|Charles Allen]], but he had never attended college.<ref name=McKivigan>McKivigan, John, [https://books.google.com/books?id=OeoaqhaZ-iMC&pg=PA67 Abolitionism and American Law], pg. 66–67</ref> According to the laws of the state, college graduates were required to study with an attorney for three years, while non-graduates were required to do so for five years.<ref name=McKivigan/>

With the encouragement of his legal mentors, Spooner set up his practice in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]] after only three years, defying the courts.<ref name=McKivigan/> He regarded the three-year privilege for college graduates as a state-sponsored discrimination against the poor and also providing a monopoly income to those who met the requirements. He argued that "no one has yet ever dared advocate, in direct terms, so monstrous a principle as that the rich ought to be protected by law from the competition of the poor".<ref name=McKivigan/> In 1836, the legislature abolished the restriction.<ref name=McKivigan/> He opposed all licensing requirements for lawyers, doctors or anyone else that was prevented from being employed by such requirements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lysanderspooner.org/node/5 |title=Biography |publisher=LysanderSpooner.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref> To prevent a person from doing business with a person without a professional license he saw as a violation of the natural [[Freedom of contract|right to contract]].<ref>Spooner, Lysander [https://books.google.com/books?id=L8Q7AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA16&dq=%22lysander+spooner%22+%22natural+right+to+contract%22+license&hl=en&ei=HRVQTca-JYnWtQPIqNjJCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&sqi=2&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false Constitutional Law, Relative to Credit, Currency and Banking], pg. 16</ref>

After a disappointing legal career and a failed career in real estate speculation in [[Ohio]], Spooner returned to his father's farm in 1840.<ref name=McKivigan/>

===American Letter Mail Company===
Being an advocate of [[self-employment]] and opponent of government regulation of business, Spooner started his own business called [[American Letter Mail Company]] which competed with the [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Post Office]]. Postal rates were notoriously high in the 1840s,<ref name=Cato>{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj15n1-1.html |title=The Challenge To The U.S. Postal Monopoly, 1839–1851 |publisher=Cato.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref> and in 1844, Spooner founded the American Letter Mail Company, which had offices in various cities, including [[Baltimore]], [[Philadelphia]], and New York.<ref>McMaster, John Bach. 1910. A History of the People of the United States. D. Appleton and Company. p. 116</ref> Stamps could be purchased and then attached to letters which could be sent to any of its offices. From here agents were dispatched who traveled on railroads and steamboats, and carried the letters in hand bags. Letters were transferred to messengers in the cities along the routes who then delivered the letters to the addressees.

This was a challenge to the United States Post Office's [[monopoly]].<ref name="Cato" /><ref>Adie, Douglas, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wPmIGtrxXb0C&pg=PA27&dq=%22lysander+spooner%22+%22post+office%22+monopoly&hl=en&ei=fw9QTaryCcbngQfFqPnmDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22lysander%20spooner%22%20%22post%20office%22%20monopoly&f=false Monopoly Mail: the Privatizing United States Postal Service], pg. 27</ref> As he had done when challenging the rules of the [[Massachusetts Bar Association]], he published a [[pamphlet]] titled "The Unconstitutionality of the Laws of Congress Prohibiting Private Mails". Although Spooner had finally found commercial success with his mail company, legal challenges by the government eventually exhausted his financial resources. A law enacted in 1851 that strengthened the federal government's monopoly finally put him out of business. The lasting legacy of Spooner's challenge to the postal service was the three-cent stamp, adopted in response to the competition his company provided.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lysanderspooner.org/STAMP3.htm |title=Spooner vs. U.S. Postal System |first=Lucille J. |last=Goodyear |work= ''lysanderspooner.org; originally published in'' American Legion Magazine  |date=January 1981 |accessdate=October 25, 2012}}</ref>

==Abolitionism==
{{Anarchism sidebar}}
Spooner attained his greatest fame as a figure in the abolitionist movement. His most famous work, a book titled ''[[The Unconstitutionality of Slavery]]'', was published in 1845. Spooner's book contributed to a controversy among abolitionists over whether the [[United States Constitution]] supported the institution of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]]. The "disunionist" faction, led by [[William Lloyd Garrison]] and [[Wendell Phillips]], argued the Constitution legally recognized and enforced the oppression of slaves (as, for example, in the provisions for the capture of fugitive slaves in Article IV, Section 2).<ref>{{Cite conference |last1=Barnett |first1=Randy E. |authorlink=Randy Barnett |title=Whence Comes Section One? The Abolitionist Origins of the Fourteenth Amendment |date=2010-02-22 |url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1538862 |publisher=Social Science Research Network |location=Rochester, NY |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.masshist.org/objects/2005july.cfm |title=Donald Yacovone, Massachusetts Historical Society: "A Covenant with Death and an Agreement with Hell" |publisher=Masshist.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229221730/http://masshist.org/objects/2005july.cfm |archivedate=December 29, 2010 |deadurl=yes }}</ref> More generally, Wendell Phillips disputed Spooner's notion that any unjust law should be held legally void by judges.<ref>Phillips, Wendell.  ''[https://archive.org/details/reviewoflysander00lcphil Review of Spooner's Essay on the Unconstitutionality of Slavery]'' (1847).</ref>

Spooner challenged the claim that the text of the Constitution permitted slavery.<ref name=UOS>{{cite web|url=http://www.lysanderspooner.org/UnconstitutionalityOfSlaveryContents.htm |title=The Unconstitutionality of Slavery |publisher=Lysanderspooner.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref> Although he recognized that the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founders]] had probably not intended to outlaw slavery when writing the Constitution, he argued that only the meaning of the text, not the private intentions of its writers, was enforceable. Spooner used a complex system of legal and natural law arguments in order to show that the clauses usually interpreted as supporting slavery did not, in fact, support it, and that several clauses of the Constitution prohibited the states from establishing slavery.<ref name=UOS/> Spooner's arguments were cited by other pro-Constitution abolitionists, such as [[Gerrit Smith]] and the [[Liberty Party (United States, 1840)|Liberty Party]], which adopted it as an official text in its 1848 platform. [[Frederick Douglass]], originally a Garrisonian disunionist, later came to accept the pro-Constitution position, and cited Spooner's arguments to explain his change of mind.<ref>Cf. Douglass, "[[What to a slave is the 4th of July?|What to the Slave is the Fourth of July]]?"</ref>

From the publication of this book until 1861, Spooner actively campaigned against slavery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lysanderspooner.org/node/7 |title=Letters by Lysander Spooner |publisher=Lysanderspooner.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref> He published subsequent pamphlets on [[Jury nullification]] and other legal defenses for escaped slaves and offered his legal services, often free of charge, to fugitives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=2181&Itemid=28 |title=Lysander Spooner, ''An Essay on the Trial by Jury'' (1852) |publisher=Oll.libertyfund.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref> In the late 1850s, copies of his book were distributed to members of Congress sparking some debate over their contents. Even Senator [[Albert G. Brown|Albert Gallatin Brown]] of [[Mississippi]], a slavery proponent, praised the argument's intellectual rigor and conceded it was the most formidable legal challenge he had seen from the abolitionists to date. In 1858, Spooner circulated a "Plan for the Abolition of Slavery", calling for the use of [[guerrilla warfare]] against slaveholders by black slaves and non-slaveholding free Southerners, with aid from Northern abolitionists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://praxeology.net/LS-PAS.htm |title=Lysander Spooner – Plan for the Abolition of Slavery |publisher=Praxeology.net |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref> Spooner also "conspir[ed] with [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] to promote a servile insurrection in the South", and participated in an aborted plot to free Brown after his capture following the failed raid on [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harper's Ferry]], [[Virginia]] (Harper's Ferry is now part of the state of [[West Virginia]]).<ref name=Raico>[[Ralph Raico|Raico, Ralph]] (2011-03-29) [https://mises.org/daily/5088/Neither-the-Wars-Nor-the-Leaders-Were-Great Neither the Wars Nor the Leaders Were Great], [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]</ref>

Although Spooner had advocated the use of violence to abolish slavery, he denounced the Republicans' use of violence to prevent the Southern states from seceding during the [[American Civil War]]. He published several letters and pamphlets about the war, arguing that the Republican objective was not to eradicate slavery, but rather to preserve the Union by force. He blamed the bloodshed on Republican political leaders, such as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward]] and Senator [[Charles Sumner]], who often criticized slavery but would not attack it on a constitutional basis, and who pursued military policies seen as vengeful and abusive.<ref name="oll.libertyfund.org">{{cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=2233&Itemid=28 |title=Lysander Spooner, Letter to Charles Sumner (1864) |publisher=Oll.libertyfund.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/dilorenzo/dilorenzo87.html |title=Spooner's Fiery Attack on Lincolnite Hypocrisy by Thomas DiLorenzo |publisher=Lewrockwell.com |date=2004-11-26 |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref>

Although he denounced the institution of slavery, Spooner recognized the right of the [[Confederate States of America]] to secede as the manifestation of government by consent, a constitutional and legal principle fundamental to Spooner's philosophy; the Northern states, in contrast, were trying to deny the [[Southern United States|Southerners]] that right through military force.<ref>''The Lysander Spooner Reader'', by George H. Smith, pp. xvii and further</ref> He "vociferously opposed the Civil War, arguing that it violated the right of the southern states to secede from a Union that no longer represented them".<ref name=Raico/> He believed they were attempting to restore the Southern states to the Union, against the wishes of Southerners. He argued that the right of the states to secede derives from the natural right of slaves to be free.<ref name="oll.libertyfund.org"/> This argument was unpopular in the North and in the South after the War began, as it conflicted with the official position of both governments.<ref>''The Lysander Spooner Reader'', by George H. Smith, p. xix</ref>

==Views on economics and self-employment==
Spooner believed that it was beneficial for people to be [[Self-employment|self-employed]] so that they could enjoy the full benefits of their labor rather than having to share them with an employer. He argued that various forms of government intervention in the free market made it difficult for people to start their own businesses. For one, he believed that laws against high interest rates, or [[usury]], prevented those with [[Capital (economics)|capital]] from extending credit because they could not be compensated for high risks of not being repaid: "If a man have not capital of his own, upon which to bestow his labor, it is necessary that he be allowed to obtain it on credit. And in order that he may be able to obtain it on credit, it is necessary that he be allowed to contract for such a rate of interest as will induce a man, having surplus capital, to loan it to him; for the capitalist cannot, consistently with natural law, be compelled to loan his capital against his will. All legislative restraints upon the rate of interest, are, therefore, nothing less than arbitrary and tyrannical restraints upon a man's natural capacity amid natural right to hire capital, upon which to bestow his labor...The effect of usury laws, then, is to give a monopoly of the right of borrowing money, to those few, who can offer the most approved security".<ref>Spooner, Lysander. 1846. ''Poverty: Its Illegal Causes and Legal Cure''. Boston: [[Bela Marsh]].</ref>

Spooner also believed that government restrictions on issuance of private money made it inordinately difficult for individuals to obtain the capital on credit to start their own businesses, thereby putting them in a situation where "a very large portion of them, to save themselves from starvation, have no alternative but to sell their labor to others" and those who do employ others are only able to afford to pay "far below what the laborers could produce, [than] if they themselves had the necessary capital to work with."<ref name="ReferenceA">Spooner's Letter to Grover Cleveland May 15, 1886</ref> Spooner said that there was "a prohibitory tax – a tax of ten per cent. – on all notes issued for circulation as money, other than the notes of the United States and the national banks" which he argued caused an artificial shortage of credit, and that eliminating this tax would result in making plenty of money available for lending<ref name="ReferenceA"/> such that: "All the great establishments, of every kind, now in the hands of a few proprietors, but employing a great number of wage labourers, would be broken up; for few or no persons, who could hire capital and do business for themselves would consent to labour for wages for another".<ref>quoted from Spooner's Letter to Grover Cleveland by Eunice Minette Schuster, ''Native American Anarchism'', p. 148</ref>

==Anarchism==
[[George Woodcock]] describes Spooner's essays as an "eloquent elaboration" of [[Josiah Warren]] and the early American development of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon's ideas]], and associates his works with that of [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Woodcock|first=George|authorlink=George Woodcock|title=Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements|year=1962|publisher=Penguin|location=Melbourne}} p. 434</ref> Woodcock also reports that both Lysander Spooner and [[William Batchelder Greene]] had been members of the [[Socialism|socialist]] [[International Workingmen's Association|First International]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Woodcock|first=George|authorlink=George Woodcock|title=Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements|year=1962|publisher=Penguin|location=Melbourne}} p. 460</ref>

==Later life and death==
[[File:Lysander Spooner Grave.JPG|thumb|250px|''Spooner's tombstone, he is interred in the historic [[Forest Hills Cemetery]]'']]
Spooner continued to write and publish extensively during the decades following Reconstruction, producing works such as "Natural Law or The Science of Justice" and "Trial By Jury". In "Trial By Jury" he defended the doctrine of [[jury nullification]], which holds that in a free society a trial jury not only has the authority to rule on the facts of the case, but also on the legitimacy of the law under which the case is tried. This doctrine would further allow juries to refuse to convict if they regard the law by which they are asked to convict as illegitimate. He became associated with [[Benjamin Tucker]]'s [[anarchism|anarchist]] journal ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'', which published all of his later works in serial format, and for which he wrote several editorial columns on current events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uncletaz.com/liberty/spooner.html |title=Lysander Spooner, Tucker & Liberty |publisher=Uncletaz.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref> He argued that "almost all fortunes are made out of the capital and labour of other men than those who realize them. Indeed, except by his sponging capital and labour from others".<ref>quoted in [[James J. Martin|Martin, James J.]] ''Men Against the State'', pp. 173ff</ref>

Spooner died on May 14, 1887, at the age of 79 in his residence, 109 Myrtle Street, Boston.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lysanderspooner.org/OBIT.htm |title=One of the Old Guard of Abolition Heroes, Dies in His Eightieth Year After a Fortnight's Illness |publisher=Lysanderspooner.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref> [[Benjamin Tucker]] arranged his funeral service and wrote a "loving [[obituary]]", entitled "Our [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]] Taken From Us", which appeared in ''Liberty'' on May 28, and predicted "that the name Lysander Spooner would be 'henceforth memorable among men'".<ref>[[Wendy McElroy|McElroy, Wendy]], [http://fff.org//explore-freedom/article/lysander-spooner-part-2/ Lysander Spooner, Part 2]</ref>

==Influence==
Spooner's influence extends to the wide range of topics he addressed during his lifetime. He is remembered primarily for his abolitionist activities and for his challenge to the [[United States Postal Service|Post Office]] monopoly, which had a lasting influence of significantly reducing postal rates.<ref>Krohn, Raymond James, [https://mises.org/journals/jls/21_2/21_2_3.pdf The Limits of Jacksonian Liberalism: Individualism, Dissent, and the Gospel of Andrew According to Lysander Spooner], ''[[Journal of Libertarian Studies]]'', Volume 21, No. 2 (Summer 2007), pp. 46–47</ref> Spooner's writings contributed to the development of both [[Left-libertarianism|left-libertarian]] and [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]] political theory in the United States, and were often reprinted in early libertarian journals such as the ''Rampart Journal''<ref>"A Letter to Thomas F. Bayard," in ''Rampart Journal'' Vol. 1, No. 1 (Spring 1965), "No Treason: The Constitution of No Authority," with an introduction by James J. Martin, in ''Rampart Journal'' Vol. 1, No. 3 (Fall 1965).</ref> and ''[[Left and Right: A Journal of Libertarian Thought]]''.<ref>[https://mises.org/journals/lar/pdfs/3_1/3_1_7.pdf ''Natural Law, Or the Science of Justice''], reprinted in ''[[Left and Right: A Journal of Libertarian Thought]]'' (Winter 1967)</ref> His writings were also a major influence on [[Austrian School]] economist [[Murray Rothbard]] and right-libertarian law professor and legal theorist [[Randy Barnett]].

In January 2004, [[Laissez Faire Books]] established the Lysander Spooner Award for advancing the literature of liberty. The honor is awarded monthly to the most important contributions to right-libertarian literature, followed by an annual award to the winner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lfb.com/index.php?action=help&helpfile=spooneraw.html |title=Lysander Spooner Award |publisher=Lfb.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref>

In 2010, LAVA created the Lysander Spooner (Book of the Year) Award, which has been awarded annually since 2011.<ref>LAVA [https://web.archive.org/web/20110413234211/http://www.lava-apa.org/ The Libertarian, Agorist, Voluntaryist & Anarchs Authors and Publishers Association]</ref> The LAVA Awards are held annually to honor excellence in books relating to the principles of liberty, with the Lysander Spooner Award being the grand prize award.

Spooner's ''The Unconstitutionality of Slavery'' was cited in the 2008 Supreme Court case ''[[District of Columbia v. Heller]]'', which struck down the federal district's ban on [[handgun]]s<nowiki/>. Justice [[Antonin Scalia]], writing for the court, quotes Spooner as saying the [[Right to keep and bear arms|right to bear arms]] was necessary for those who wanted to take a stand against slavery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/554/07-290/opinion.html |title=District of Columbia v. Heller 554 U. S. ____ – US Supreme Court Cases from Justia & Oyez |publisher=Supreme.justia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref> It was also cited by Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] in his concurring opinion in ''[[McDonald v. Chicago]]'' the following year.<ref>{{cite web|author=Justice Thomas |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-1521.ZC1.html |title=Mv.
