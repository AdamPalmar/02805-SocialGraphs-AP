==Career and thought==
In the years 2003–04 Lottieri taught Philosophy of Social Sciences at [[Ca' Foscari University of Venice]] and in 2011 he has been visiting professor at [[University of Provence|Aix-en-Provence]]. Fellow of many institutions,<ref>[http://www.icer.it/ International Centre of Economic Research de Turin], [https://www.mises.org/ The Ludwig von Mises Institute], [http://www.ies-europe.org Institute of Economic Studies], [http://www.institutconstant.ch/index.php Institut Constant de Rebecque].</ref> he is the Director of Political Theory department of the [[Istituto Bruno Leoni]] (IBL), based in Turin.<ref>For IBL Lottieri has written many papers in defense of individual rights and free-market values. See for instance: Carlo Lottieri, [http://brunoleonimedia.servingfreedom.net/BP/IBL_BP_20_EU_China_en.pdf The Opening of the Chinese Market and Individual Rights] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925113041/http://brunoleonimedia.servingfreedom.net/BP/IBL_BP_20_EU_China_en.pdf |date=September 25, 2011 }}, IBL Briefing Paper, June 25, 2005.</ref>
Lottieri's research develops a radical libertarianism combining a strong emphasis on the inviolability of other people (marked by the influence of [[Emmanuel Lévinas]]) and a realistic approach to the modern State, largely influenced by [[Elitism|Italian elitist school]], [[Carl Schmitt]]'s scholarship and [[Public Choice]] and [[Austrian School]] economists. Following Raimondo Cubeddu and Alberto Mingardi, in his work Lottieri "argues for the legitimacy of many so-called 'monopolistic practices' (cartels, monopolization, mergers,  predatory pricing…), and for the legitimacy of conglomerates, and big business at large,  vis-à-vis those governmental agencies built to thoroughly implement 'competition' from top to bottom".<ref>Raimondo Cubeddu - Alberto Mingardi, "Preface", ''Ethics & Politics'', 2003, 2, p. 2.</ref>
His last book emphasizes the historic features of the modern State, suggesting to libertarian scholars to understand the cultural and even theological implications of the struggle between the rulers and the ruled.<ref>Partially, this topic had been examined in a previous paper written in cooperation with an Italian colleague: Luigi Marco Bassani - Carlo Lottieri, "The Problem of Security; Historicity of the State and "European Realism", in Hans-Hermann Hoppe, ''The Myth of National Defense'', Auburn AL, The Ludwig von Mises Institute, 2003.</ref>
