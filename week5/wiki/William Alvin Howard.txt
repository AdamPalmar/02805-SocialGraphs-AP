'''William Alvin Howard''' (born 1926) is a [[proof theorist]] best known for his work demonstrating formal similarity between [[intuitionistic logic]] and the [[simply typed lambda calculus]] that has come to be known as the [[Curry–Howard correspondence]].  He has also been active in the theory of proof-theoretic ordinals.  He earned his [[Ph.D.]] at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1956 for a dissertation entitled "k-fold recursion and well-ordering".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://catalog.lib.uchicago.edu/vufind/Record/4242603/Holdings#tabnav | title=Holdings: k-fold recursion and well-ordering | publisher=The University of Chicago Library Catalog | accessdate=2015-05-04}}</ref> He was a student of [[Saunders Mac Lane]].

The [[Howard ordinal]] (also known as the Bachmann–Howard ordinal) was named after him.
