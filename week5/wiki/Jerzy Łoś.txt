'''Jerzy Łoś''' (born March 22, 1920 in Lwów, Poland (now [[Lviv]], Ukraine) – June 1, 1998 in [[Warsaw]]) ({{IPA-pol|ˈjɛʐɨ ˈwɔɕ}}) was a [[Poland|Polish]] mathematician, logician, economist, and philosopher. He is especially known for his work in [[model theory]], in particular for "[[Ultraproduct#.C5.81o.C5.9B.27_theorem|&#321;o&#347;'s theorem]]", which states that any [[first-order predicate calculus|first-order]] formula is true in an ultraproduct if and only if it is true in "most" factors (see [[ultraproduct]] for details). In model theory he also proved many preservation theorems, but he gave significant contributions, as well, to [[foundations of mathematics]], [[Abelian group|Abelian group theory]] and [[universal algebra]]. In the 60's he turned his attention to [[mathematical economics]], focusing mainly on production processes and dynamic decision processes.

He was faculty at academies in Wrocław, Toruń, and Warsaw.

In 1996 Łoś suffered from a severe brain stroke. He was thenceforward ill until his death in 1998.
