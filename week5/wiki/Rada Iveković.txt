'''Rada Iveković''' (born 1945 in [[Zagreb]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]) is a Croatian professor, [[Philosophy|philosopher]], [[Indology|Indologist]], and writer.

== Research ==
Ivekovic’s research interests include [[comparative philosophy]] ([[Asian philosophy]], particularly [[Indian philosophy|Indian]], and [[Western philosophy|Western]]), [[feminist theory]] and [[feminist philosophy]] as well as [[political philosophy]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In particular, the following aspects have been of intellectual inspiration for Ivekovic’s work:  [[contemporary European philosophy]], [[postmodern philosophy]], [[Orientalism]] in (Western) philosophy, the feminine in philosophy, issues of [[nation]], [[Sovereign state|state]] und [[citizenship]], problems of [[nationalism]], of [[violence]] and [[war]], European [[Cultural identity|identity]] issues, and [[democracy]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Ivekovic’s other interests include: [[literary theory]] and [[literary criticism]], [[religion]] and [[mythology]], [[gender studies]] and [[women writers]], [[anthropology]], and  [[contemporary French philosophy]] in particular.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

== Political positioning ==
Ivekovic holds that the inequality of the sexes (Inégalité des sexes) and other [[Alterity|alterities]], [[social equality|inequalities]], [[Outcast (person)|exclusion]]s, subordinating [[Inclusion (value and practice)|inclusion]]s (e.g. through discrimination by  [[gender]], [[Nation|national citizenship]], [[ethnicity]], [[colonization]]) leads to a fatal partitioning of reason ("Le partage de la raison"). On the war events on the territory of Yugoslavia she takes an explicitly anti-patriarchal, anti-racist and non-nationalist stance.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In 1997 Ivekovic published a study on gender/sex in philosophy, taking issue with [[Jean-François Lyotard]].

== Career ==
Iveković grew up mostly in [[Zagreb]] and [[Belgrade]], living in Zagreb, from 1963 until leaving Croatia for exile in 1991-1992 in a self-described "protest against nationalism."

At [[Zagreb University]], she studied Indology, Philosophy and English Studies (1969) and from 1970 to 1973, [[Buddhist philosophy]] at [[Delhi University]] where she received her PhD in 1972.

From 1975 to 1991-1992, Iveković was a Lecturer in the History of Asian Philosophy and Comparative Philosophy at Zagreb University. From 1998-2003 she was a professor at Paris VIII.
