'''Todd May''' (born 1955 in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]]) is a [[political philosophy|political philosopher]] notable for his role in developing, alongside [[Saul Newman]] and [[Lewis Call]], the theory of [[post-structuralist anarchism]].<ref>May prefers this term to the more widely used "postanarchism", given the latter's connotation of a philosophy that is "after" or has transcended [[classical anarchism]].</ref> He is currently Class of 1941 Memorial Professor of Philosophy at [[Clemson University]] and contributes to ''[[CounterPunch]]''. His 1994 book ''The Political Philosophy of Poststructuralist Anarchism'' was the first to combine [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] and [[anarchist]] thought, and he subsequently has published treatments of major poststructuralist philosophers, including [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Michel Foucault]].  He serves as faculty adviser for several student-run political organizations.
