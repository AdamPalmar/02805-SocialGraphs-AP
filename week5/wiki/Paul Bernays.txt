'''Paul Isaac Bernays''' (17 October 1888 – 18 September 1977) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] mathematician, who made significant contributions to [[mathematical logic]], [[axiomatic set theory]], and the [[philosophy of mathematics]]. He was an assistant and close collaborator of [[David Hilbert]].

==Biography==

Bernays spent his childhood in Berlin, and attended the Köllner Gymnasium, 1895-1907. At the [[University of Berlin]], he studied mathematics under [[Issai Schur]], [[Edmund Landau]], [[Ferdinand Georg Frobenius]], and [[Friedrich Schottky]]; philosophy under [[Alois Riehl]], [[Carl Stumpf]] and [[Ernst Cassirer]]; and physics under [[Max Planck]]. At the [[University of Göttingen]], he studied mathematics under [[David Hilbert]], [[Edmund Landau]], [[Hermann Weyl]], and [[Felix Klein]]; physics under Voigt and [[Max Born]]; and philosophy under [[Leonard Nelson]].

In 1912, the [[University of Berlin]] awarded him a Ph.D. in mathematics, for a thesis, supervised by Landau, on the analytic number theory of [[binary quadratic form]]s. That same year, the [[University of Zurich]] awarded him the [[Habilitation]] for a thesis on [[complex analysis]] and [[Picard's theorem]]. The examiner was [[Ernst Zermelo]]. Bernays was Privatdozent at the University of Zurich, 1912–17, where he came to know [[George Pólya]].

Starting in 1917, [[David Hilbert]] employed Bernays to assist him with his investigations of the foundations of arithmetic. Bernays also lectured on other areas of mathematics at the University of Göttingen. In 1918, that university awarded him a second Habilitation, for a thesis on the axiomatics of the [[propositional calculus]] of ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Zach |first=Richard |author-link=Richard Zach |date=1999 |title=Completeness before Post: Bernays, Hilbert, and the development of propositional logic

In 1922, Göttingen appointed Bernays extraordinary professor without tenure. His most successful student there was [[Gerhard Gentzen]]. In 1933, he was dismissed from this post because of his Jewish ancestry. After working privately for Hilbert for six months, Bernays and his family moved to [[Switzerland]], whose nationality he had inherited from his father, and where the [[ETH]] employed him on occasion. He also visited the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and was a visiting scholar at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in 1935-36 and again in 1959-60.<ref>[http://www.ias.edu/people/cos/index.html Institute for Advanced Study: A Community of Scholars]</ref>

==Mathematical work==

Bernays's collaboration with Hilbert culminated in the two volume work [[Grundlagen der Mathematik]] by  {{harvs|txt|last1=Hilbert|last2=Bernays|year1=1934|year2=1939}}, discussed in Sieg and Ravaglia (2005). In seven papers, published between 1937 and 1954 in the ''[[Journal of Symbolic Logic]]'', republished in {{harv|Müller|1976}}, Bernays set out an [[axiomatic set theory]] whose starting point was a related theory [[John von Neumann]] had set out in the 1920s. Von Neumann's theory took the notions of [[function (set theory)|function]] and [[argument of a function|argument]] as primitive; Bernays recast von Neumann's theory so that [[Class (set theory)|class]]es and [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] were primitive. Bernays's theory, with some modifications by [[Kurt Gödel]], is now known as [[von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]].
A proof from the ''Grundlagen der Mathematik'' that a sufficiently strong consistent theory cannot contain its own reference functor is now known as the [[Hilbert–Bernays paradox]].
