== Education ==
Before obtaining her two doctorates in [[Doctor of Sacred Theology|sacred theology]] and [[philosophy]] from the [[University of Fribourg]], [[Switzerland]], she received her [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[English language|English]] from [[The College of Saint Rose]], her M.A. in English from [[The Catholic University of America]], and a doctorate in religion from [[Saint Mary's College (Indiana)|Saint Mary's College]].

== Career ==
Daly taught classes at Boston College from 1967 to 1999, including courses in theology, feminist [[ethics]], and [[patriarchy]].

Daly was first threatened with dismissal when, following the publication of her first book, ''The Church and the Second Sex'' (1968), she was issued a terminal [[contract]]. As a result of support from the (then all-male) student body and the general public, however, Daly was ultimately granted [[tenure]].

Daly's refusal to admit male students to some of her classes at Boston College also resulted in disciplinary action. While Daly argued that their presence inhibited class discussion, Boston College took the view that her actions were in violation of [[title IX]] of federal law requiring the college to ensure that no person was excluded from an education program on the basis of sex, and of the university's own non-discrimination policy insisting that all courses be open to both male and female students.

In 1989, Daly became an associate of the [[Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wifp.org/who-we-are/associates/|title=Associates {{!}}  The Women’s Institute for Freedom of the Press|website=www.wifp.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-21}}</ref>

In 1998, a [[discrimination]] claim against the college by two male students was backed by the [[Center for Individual Rights]], a conservative advocacy group. Following further reprimand, Daly absented herself from classes rather than admit the male students.<ref>{{Cite web| last = Seele| first = Michael| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Daly's Absence Prompts Cancellations| work = | publisher = The Boston College Chronicle| date = March 4, 1999| url = http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/rvp/pubaf/chronicle/v7/mr4/daly.html| doi = | accessdate = }}</ref> Boston College removed her tenure rights, citing a verbal agreement by Daly to retire. She brought suit against the college disputing violation of her tenure rights and claimed she was forced out against her will, but her request for an [[injunction]] was denied by Middlesex Superior Court Judge [[Martha Sosman]].<ref>{{Cite web| last = Sullivan| first = Mark| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Judge Denies Daly's Bid for Injunction| work = | publisher = The Boston College Chronicle| date = May 28, 1999| url = http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/rvp/pubaf/chronicle/v7/my28/daly.html| doi = | accessdate = }}</ref>

A confidential [[out-of-court settlement]] was reached. The college maintains that Daly had agreed to retire from her faculty position,<ref>{{Cite web| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Mary Daly Ends Suit, Agrees to Retire| work = | publisher = The Boston College Chronicle| date = February 15, 2001| url = http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/rvp/pubaf/chronicle/v9/f15/daly.html| doi = | accessdate = }}</ref> while others assert she was forced out.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Pippin |first=Tina |editor1-first=Edward L. |editor1-last=Queen II |editor2-first=Stephen R. |editor2-last=Prothero |editor3-first=Gardiner H. |editor3-last=Shattuck, Jr. |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of American Religious History |title=Mary Daley |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u-_6P2rMy2wC&pg=PA326 |accessdate=August 25, 2011 |edition=3d |year=2009 |publisher=Facts on File |volume=3 |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8160-6660-5 |page=326 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/panelists/susan_brooks_thistlethwaite/2010/01/the_courage_to_sin_big_the_life_of_mary_daly.html |title=Mary Daly's 'Courage to Sin Big' |last=Thistlethwaite |first=Susan Brooks |date=January 5, 2010 |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=August 25, 2011 }}</ref> Daly maintained that Boston College wronged her students by depriving her of her right to teach freely to only female students.<ref>{{Cite web| last = Kettle| first = Martin| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Unholy row as feminist lecturer bars men| work = | publisher = The Guardian| date = February 27, 1999| url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/feb/27/martinkettle| doi = | accessdate = }}</ref> She documented her account of the events in the 2006 book, ''Amazon Grace: Recalling the Courage to Sin Big''.

Daly protested the commencement speech of [[Condoleezza Rice]] at Boston College, and she spoke on campuses around the United States as well as internationally.<ref>{{Cite web| last = Elton| first = Catherine| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Efforts mount against BC's Rice invitation| work = | publisher = The Boston Globe| date = May 9, 2006| url = http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/05/09/efforts_mount_against_bcs_rice_invitation/| doi = | accessdate = }}</ref>

== Works ==
Daly published a number of works, and is perhaps best known for her second book, ''Beyond God the Father'' (1973). ''Beyond God the Father'' is the last book in which Daly really considers God a substantive subject. She laid out her systematic theology, following [[Paul Tillich]]’s example.<ref name=Riswold>{{Cite book| last = Riswold| first = Caryn D.| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Two Reformers| publisher = Wipf & Stock Publishers| year = 2007| location = Eugene, OR| pages = 33| url = | doi =  | isbn = 1-59752-826-9}}</ref> Often regarded as a foundational work in feminist theology, ''Beyond God the Father'' is her attempt to explain and overcome [[androcentrism]] in [[Western religion]], and it is notable for its playful writing style and its attempt to rehabilitate "God-talk" for the [[women's liberation movement]] by critically building on the writing of existentialist theologians such as Paul Tillich and [[Martin Buber]]. While the former increasingly characterized her writing, she soon abandoned the latter.

In ''Gyn/Ecology: The Metaethics of Radical Feminism'' (1978), Daly argues that men throughout history have sought to oppress women. In this book she moves beyond her previous thoughts on the history of patriarchy to the focus on the actual practices that, in her view, perpetuate patriarchy, which she calls a religion.<ref name=Riswold />

Daly’s ''Pure Lust: Elemental Feminist Philosophy'' (1984) and ''Websters' First New Intergalactic Wickedary of the English Language'' (1987) introduce and explore an alternative language to explain the process of exorcism and ecstasy. In ''Wickedary'' Daly provides definitions as well as chants that she says can be used by women to free themselves from patriarchal oppression. She also explores the labels that she says patriarchal society places on women to prolong what she sees as male domination of society. Daly said it is the role of women to unveil the liberatory nature of labels such as “Hag”, “Witch”, and “Lunatic”.<ref name=Ruether>{{Cite book| last = Ruether| first = Rosemary Radford| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Women and Redemption: A Theological History| publisher = Fortress Press| year = 1998| location = Minneapolis| pages = 218–9| url = | doi =  | isbn = 0-8006-2947-7}}</ref>

Daly's work continues to influence feminism and [[feminist theology]], as well as the developing concept of [[biophilia hypothesis|biophilia]] as an alternative and challenge to social necrophilia. She was an [[Ethics of eating meat|ethical vegetarian]] and [[animal rights]] activist. ''Gyn/Ecology'', ''Pure Lust'', and ''Websters' First New Intergalactic Wickedary'' all endorse anti-[[Animal testing|vivisection]] and anti-[[Fur clothing|fur]] positions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Daly was a member of the advisory board of Feminists For Animal Rights, a group which is now defunct.

Daly created her own theological anthropology based around the context of what it means to be a woman. She created a thought-praxis that separates the world into the world of false images that create oppression and the world of communion in true being. She labeled these two areas foreground and Background respectively. Daly considered the foreground the realm of patriarchy and the Background the realm of Woman. She argued that the Background is under and behind the surface of the false reality of the foreground. The foreground, for Daly, was a distortion of true being, the paternalistic society in which she said most people live. It has no real energy, but drains the “life energy” of women residing in the Background. In her view, the foreground creates a world of poisons that contaminate natural life. She called the male-centered world of the foreground necrophilic, hating all living things. In contrast, she conceived of the Background as a place where all living things connect.<ref name=Ruether /><ref name=Hoagland>{{Citation| last = Hoagland| first = Sarah Lucia| author-link = | last2 = Frye| first2 = Marilyn| author2-link = | title = Feminist interpretations of Mary Daly| place = | publisher = Penn State Press| year = 2000| volume = | edition = | pages =60, 267| url = | doi =  | isbn = 0-271-02019-9}}</ref>

=== Gyn/Ecology ===
According to Lucy Sargisson, "Daly seeks in Gyn/Ecology (1987) a true, wild, Woman's self, which she perceives to be dormant in women, temporarily pacified by patriarchal systems of domination."<ref>{{cite book |last= Sargisson |first= Lucy |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Tq2XYE9xgdQC&pg=PA184 |title= Contemporary feminist utopianism |location= London; New York |publisher= Routledge |year= 1996 |page= 184 |isbn= 978-0-41-514175-8}}</ref>

[[Audre Lorde]] expressed concern over ''Gyn/Ecology'', citing  homogenizing tendencies, and a refusal to acknowledge the "[[herstory]] and myth" of women of color.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Audre| first = Lorde| authorlink = Audre_Lorde| coauthors = | title = An Open Letter to Mary Daly| publisher = Crossing Press| year = 1984| location = Berkeley| pages = 66–71| url = | doi =  | isbn = }}</ref> The letter,<ref>Audre Lorde's letter is discussed in Dr. Daly's book, ''Outercourse''.</ref> and Daly's apparent decision not to publicly respond, greatly affected the reception of Daly's work among other feminist theorists, and has been described as a "paradigmatic example of challenges to white feminist theory by feminists of color in the 1980s."<ref name= Hoagland/>

Daly's reply letter to Lorde,<ref>''Amazon Grace'' (N.Y.: Palgrave Macmillan, 1st ed. [1st printing?] Jan. 2006), pp. 25–26 (reply text).</ref> dated 4½ months later, was found in 2003 in Lorde's files after she died.<ref>''Amazon Grace'', supra, pp. 22–26, esp. pp. 24–26 & nn. 15–16, citing ''Warrior Poet: A Biography of Audre Lorde'', by Alexis De Veaux (N.Y.: W.W. Norton, 1st ed. 2004) ({{ISBN|0393019543}} or {{ISBN|0-393-32935-6}}).</ref> Daly's reply was followed in a week by a meeting with Lorde at which Daly said, among other things, that ''Gyn/Ecology'' was not a compendium of goddesses but limited to "those goddess myths and symbols that were direct sources of Christian myth," but whether this was accepted by Lorde was unknown at the time.<ref>See ''Amazon Grace'', supra, p. 23 ("week" per pp. 24 & 23).</ref>

=== Papers ===
After her death, Daly's papers were contributed to the Sophia Smith Collection of Women's History at [[Smith College]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.smith.edu/libraries/sites/default/files/fa2009.pdf |title=Noteworthy Acquisitions |date=Fall 2009 |page=2 |work=Friends of the Smith Library Collections |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160830231023/http://www.smith.edu/libraries/sites/default/files/fa2009.pdf |archivedate=August 30, 2016 |accessdate=June 6, 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Emily Erwin |last=Culpepper |date=Fall 2012 |title=Special Section in Memory of Mary Daly: Introduction |journal=Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion |volume=28 |number=2 |pages=89–90 |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/490248 |via=[[Project MUSE]] |subscription=yes |accessdate=June 6, 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Mary Daly Reader |editor1-first=Jennifer |editor1-last=Rycenga |editor2-first=Linda |editor2-last=Barufaldi |year=2017 |publisher=New York University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4798-7776-8 |chapter=Acknowledgements |page=xxi |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=yAbvCwAAQBAJ&pg=PR21 |accessdate=June 6, 2017 }}</ref>

== Personal views ==

=== On religion ===
In ''The Church and the Second Sex'', Daly argued that religion and equality between women and men are not mutually exclusive. In her early works she sought to change religion and create an equal place for women in Catholicism by calling the church out on injustice and insisting on change.  In the course of her writings her view of religion changed. She regarded [[organized religion]] as inherently oppressive toward women by the time she wrote ''Beyond God and Father'',<ref>{{cite book |last1= Hoagland |first1= Sarah Lucia | author1link = Sarah Hoagland|last2= Frye |first2= Marilyn | author2link = Marilyn Frye|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zJbudh1l36YC&pg=PA114 |title= Feminist interpretations of Mary Daly |location= University Park, Pa. |publisher= Pennsylvania State University |year= 2000 |isbn= 978-0-27-102018-1|page= 114}}</ref> stating that "woman's asking for equality in the church would be comparable to a black person's demanding equality in the [[Ku Klux Klan]]".<ref>{{cite book |last= King |first= Nicholas |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=XeusKyOcgtgC&pg=PA41 |title= Whispers of liberation: Feminist perspectives on the New Testament |location= New York |publisher= [[Paulist Press]] |year= 1998 |isbn= 978-0-80-913816-6 |page= 41}}</ref>

Daly eventually gave up on theology, believing it to be hopelessly [[patriarchal]], and she turned her efforts towards philosophical feminism. She saw the Catholic Church as fundamentally corrupt, but it still had some value to her, as was evidenced by her love for her copy of ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' in her later days.<ref>[[Judith Plaskow]]. "Lessons from Mary Daly." ''Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion'' 28.2 (2012): 100-104. {{doi|10.2979/jfemistudreli.28.2.100}} [[Project MUSE]]. Web. 2 Dec. 2014. <http://muse.jhu.edu/>.</ref> After all, her Catholic upbringing and education as well as her views on the church are what sparked her career and later work. Despite her abandonment of the subject, Daly’s work opened the door for many more feminist theologians after her. Even when she moved on from the study of religion her ideas remained and inspired many of her contemporaries.<ref>Hunt, M. (2014).

''[[Feminist Theology (journal)|Feminist Theology]]'', 22(3), 219-228. {{doi|10.1177/0966735014522565}}</ref>

=== On feminism ===
In ''Gyn/Ecology'' (1978), she criticized the "Equal Rights" feminist framework. Many feminist thinkers consider the choice to use an "equality" lens (also known as an "equity" or "equality" framework) a distinctive mark of politically liberal, rather than politically radical or postmodern, feminisms.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Morley|first1=Luise|authorlink1=The Micropolitics of Women's Studies|editor1-last=Maynard|editor1-first=Mary|editor2-last=Purvis|editor2-first=June|title=HeteroSexual Politics|date=1995|publisher=Taylor & Francis|accessdate=19 March 2017|quote= In terms of the well-established triad of definitions of feminist theory (radical, socialist, and liberal), the equality discourse is firmly located within liberal, reformist ideology.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Liberal Feminism|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-liberal/#EquFem|website=Standford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=19 March 2017|quote= Equity feminism is a form of classical-liberal or libertarian feminism that holds that feminism's political role is simply to ensure that everyone's, including women's, right against coercive interference is respected (Sommers 1994, 22). Wendy McElroy, an equity feminist writes: "I've always maintained that the only reason I call myself a feminist is because of [the] gov[ernment]. By which I mean, if the government (or an anarchist defense assoc[iation]) acknowledged the full equal rights of women without paternalistic protection or oppression, I would stop writing about women's issues" (McElroy 1998c)."}}</ref> Daly's argument was that the equality framework serves to distract women from the radical goal of altering or abolishing patriarchy as a whole, directing them instead towards gaining reforms within the existing system.<ref name="Beacon Press">{{Cite book|last1=Daly|first1=Mary|title=Gyn/Ecology: The Metaethics of Radical Feminism|date=1991|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston, Mass.|pages=375–376}}</ref> According to Daly, such reforms leave women vulnerable because, though they grant nominal legal equality with men, the larger structures of patriarchy are left intact, and the later repeal of reforms is always possible.<ref name="Beacon Press"/> She also argued that the "equality" framework de-centers women from feminist thought when it encourages women to assimilate into male-dominated movements or institutions.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Daly|first1=Mary|title=Gyn/Ecology: The Metaethics of Radical Feminism|date=1991|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston, Mass.|pages=374–377}}</ref>

=== On men ===
In ''The Church and the Second Sex'', Daly argued for the equality between the sexes and stated that the church must acknowledge the importance of equality between men and women.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Hoagland |first1= Sarah Lucia |last2= Frye |first2= Marilyn |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zJbudh1l36YC&pg=PA114 |title= Feminist interpretations of Mary Daly |location= University Park, Pa. |publisher= Pennsylvania State University |year= 2000 |isbn= 978-0-27-102018-1|page= 114 |quote= Daly's first work, ''The Church and The Second Sex'', was written in a Roman Catholic context. She argues for equality between men and women. The church must acknowledge the importance of striving for equality, otherwise it will look as if Christianity is an enemy of human progress. At the end of the 1960s, Daly argued for the fundamental equality of women and men in theological terms. She looks at Thomas Aquinas's concepts of woman and soul.}}</ref> She wrote that women and men were created equal.<ref>{{cite book |last= Castro |first= Ginette |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DYuBjJXGsZkC&pg=PA46| title= American feminism: a contemporary history |location= New York |publisher= New York University Press |year= 1990 |page= 46 |isbn= 978-0-81-471435-5 |quote= Mary Daly asserted that woman is equal to man from her origin, for God created her as a perfect being in His own image... Mary Daly gives an egalitarian reinterpretation of the Creation myth}}</ref>

In ''Beyond God and Father'' (1973), she still believed that equality was important but argued more in terms of sexual difference than sexual equality.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Hoagland |first1= Sarah Lucia |last2= Frye |first2= Marilyn |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zJbudh1l36YC&pg=PA114 |title= Feminist interpretations of Mary Daly |location= University Park, Pa. |publisher= Pennsylvania State University |year= 2000 |isbn= 978-0-27-102018-1|page= 114 |quote= In her second feminist work, ''Beyond God and Father'' (1973), Daly continues to criticize the essentialist concept of woman. She still sees equality between the sexes as an important goal, even though women's autonomy is primary. However, she no loner thinks in terms of equality, but rather in terms of difference, and she describes her position as radical feminism.}}</ref>

In a 1999 interview with ''[[What Is Enlightenment? (magazine)|What Is Enlightenment?]]'' magazine, Daly said, "''I don't think about men.'' I really don't care about them. I'm concerned with ''women's'' capacities, which have been infinitely diminished under patriarchy. Not that they've disappeared, but they've been made subliminal. I'm concerned with ''women'' enlarging our capacities, actualizing them. So that takes all my energy."<ref name=Enlightenment>{{Cite web| last = Bridle| first = Susan| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = No Man's Land| work = | publisher = EnlightenNext Magazine| date = Fall–Winter 1999| url = | doi =}}</ref>

Later in the interview, she said, "If life is to survive on this planet, there must be a decontamination of the Earth. I think this will be accompanied by an evolutionary process that will result in a drastic reduction of the population of males."<ref name=Enlightenment />

=== On transsexualism ===
In ''Gyn/Ecology,'' Daly asserted her negative view of [[transsexualism]], writing, "Today the Frankenstein phenomenon is omnipresent .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. phallocratic technology.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Transsexualism is an example of male surgical siring which invades the female world with substitutes."<ref>Daly, Mary, ''Gyn/Ecology: The Metaethics of Radical Feminism'' (Boston, Mass.: Beacon Press, pbk. [1st printing? printing of [19]90?] 1978 & 1990 (prob. all content except ''New Intergalactic Introduction'' 1978 & prob. ''New Intergalactic Introduction'' 1990) ({{ISBN|0-8070-1413-3}})), pp. 70–71 (page break within ellipsis between sentences) (''New Intergalactic Introduction'' is separate from ''Introduction: The Metapatriarchal Journey of Exorcism and Ecstasy'').</ref> "Transsexualism, which Janice Raymond has shown to be essentially a male problem, is an ''attempt'' to change males into females, whereas in fact no male can assume female chromosomes and life history/experience."<ref>Daly, Mary, ''Gyn/Ecology'', ''op. cit.'', p. 238 n.</ref> "The surgeons and hormone therapists of the transsexual kingdom .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. can be said to produce feminine persons. They cannot produce women."<ref>Daly, Mary, ''Gyn/Ecology'', ''op. cit.'', p. 68 (n. 60 (at end) omitted).</ref>

Daly was the dissertation advisor to [[Janice Raymond]], whose dissertation was published in 1979 as ''[[The Transsexual Empire]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Highleyman |first=Liz |date=7 January 2010 |title=Feminist theologian Mary Daly dies |url=http://ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&article=4464 |newspaper=The Bay Area Reporter |access-date=27 September 2015}}</ref>

Brittany Shoot criticized Daly as [[transphobic]] for these views.<ref>{{cite web|last=Shoot|first=Brittany|title=The Biotic Woman: Talking About Transphobia and Ecofeminism With Ida Hammer|url=http://bitchmagazine.org/post/the-biotic-woman-talking-about-transphobia-and-ecofeminism-with-ida-hammer}}</ref>
