'''Gianfranco Sanguinetti''' (born July 16, 1948, [[Pully]], [[Switzerland]]), was a writer and member of the [[Situationist International]] (SI), a political art movement. He is [[Teresa Mattei]]'s son.

== Biography ==
Sanguinetti was deported from [[France]] in 1971 and settled in [[Italy]].

By 1972, Sanguinetti and [[Guy Debord]] were the only two remaining members of the SI. Together they wrote "The Veritable Split In The International" a book detailing the rise and fall of the SI.<ref>[http://netartreview.net/weeklyFeatures/2005_05_22_archive.html NAR Features<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Again working with Debord, in August 1975, Sanguinetti wrote a pamphlet titled ''Rapporto veridico sulle ultima opportunita di salvare il capitalismo in Italia'' ([[English language|Eng]]: ''The Real Report on the Last Chance to Save Capitalism in Italy''), which (inspired by [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] and [[Bruno Bauer]]) purported to be the cynical writing of "Censor", a powerful [[industrialist]]. The pamphlet was to show how the ruling class of Italy supported the  [[Piazza Fontana bombing]] and other covert, [[false flag]] mass slaughter, for the higher goal of defending the capitalist status quo from the communist claims. The pamphlet was mailed to 520 of Italy's most powerful individuals. It was received as genuine, and powerful politicians, industrialists and journalist praised its content and guessed on the identity of its high-profile author. After reprinting the tract into a small book, Sanguinetti revealed himself to be the true author. Scandal raised after the revelation, as it successfully exposed the truth and hypocrisy on the mass slaughters,<ref>[http://www.notbored.org/report.html Gianfranco Sanguinetti<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and under pressure from Italian authorities, Sanguinetti left Italy in February 1976, and was denied entry to France.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}
