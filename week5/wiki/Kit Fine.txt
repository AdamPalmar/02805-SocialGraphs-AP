Fine has described his general approach to philosophy as follows:  "I’m firmly of the opinion that real progress in philosophy can only come from taking common sense seriously. A departure from common sense is usually an indication that a mistake has been made."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/metaphysical-kit/ |title=Metaphysical Kit » 3:AM Magazine |publisher=3ammagazine.com |date=2012-03-23 |accessdate=2015-10-19}}</ref>
