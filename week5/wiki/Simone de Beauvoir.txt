'''Simone Lucie Ernestine Marie Bertrand de Beauvoir''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ə|_|ˈ|b|oʊ|ˌ|v|w|ɑr}} or {{IPAc-en|d|ə|_|ˌ|b|oʊ|ˈ|v|w|ɑr}};<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/de_beauvoir,_simone|title=de Beauvoir, Simone|work=[[Oxford American Dictionary]]|access-date=9 February 2017}}</ref> {{IPA-fr|simɔn də bovwaʁ|-|Fr-Simone de Beauvoir.ogg}}; 9 January 1908 – 14 April 1986) was a French writer, intellectual, [[Existentialism|existentialist philosopher]], political activist, [[feminist]] and [[social theorist]]. Though she did not consider herself a philosopher, she had a significant influence on both [[feminist existentialism]] and [[feminist theory]].<ref name="plato.stanford">Bergoffen, Debra, "Simone de Beauvoir", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Fall 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = <http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/beauvoir/>.</ref>

De Beauvoir wrote novels, essays, biographies, autobiography and [[monograph]]s on philosophy, politics and social issues. She was known for her 1949 treatise ''[[The Second Sex]]'', a detailed analysis of women's oppression and a foundational tract of contemporary [[feminism]]; and for her novels, including ''[[She Came to Stay]]'' and ''[[The Mandarins]]''. She was also known for her lifelong [[open relationship]] with French philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].

==Early years==
===Family===
Simone de Beauvoir was born in Paris on 9 January 1908. Her parents were Georges Bertrand de Beauvoir, a legal secretary who once aspired to be an actor,<ref name = "IEP Biography">Mussett, Shannon. [http://www.iep.utm.edu/beauvoir/#H1 Simone de Beauvoir Biography on the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]. Retrieved 11 April 2010.</ref> and Françoise de Beauvoir (née Brasseur), a wealthy banker's daughter and devout Catholic. Simone's sister, [[Hélène de Beauvoir|Hélène]], was born two years later. The family struggled to maintain their bourgeois status after losing much of their fortune shortly after [[World War I]], and Françoise insisted that the two daughters be sent to a prestigious convent school. De Beauvoir herself was deeply religious as a child, at one point intending to become a nun. She experienced a [[crisis of faith]] at age 14, after which she remained an [[atheism|atheist]] for the rest of her life.<ref name = Thurman>Thurman, Judith.

Retrieved 11 April 2010.</ref>

===Education===
De Beauvoir was intellectually precocious, fueled by her father's encouragement; he reportedly would boast, "Simone thinks like a man!"<ref>Bair, p. 60</ref> Because of her family's straitened circumstances, de Beauvoir could no longer rely on her dowry, and like other middle-class girls of her age, her marriage opportunities were put at risk. De Beauvoir took this opportunity to do what she always wanted to do while also taking steps to earn a living for herself.<ref name="oxfordreference.com">Roberts, Mary Louise. "Beauvoir, Simone de." In The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History. Oxford University Press, 2008. [http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195148909.001.0001/acref-9780195148909-e-90 Source].

After passing baccalaureate exams in mathematics and philosophy in 1925, she studied mathematics at the [[Institut Catholique de Paris]] and literature/languages at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Institut Sainte-Marie|fr}}. She then studied philosophy at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] and after completing her degree in 1928, she wrote her ''{{Interlanguage link multi|diplôme d'études supérieures|fr}}'' (roughly equivalent to an [[Master of Arts|MA]] thesis) on [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] for [[Léon Brunschvicg]] (the topic was "Le concept chez Leibniz" ["The Concept in Leibniz"]).<ref>Margaret A. Simons (ed.), ''Feminist Interpretations of Simone de Beauvoir'', Penn State Press, Nov 1, 2010, p. 3.</ref> De Beauvoir was only the ninth woman to have received a degree from the Sorbonne at the time, due to the fact that French women had only recently been allowed to join higher education.<ref name="oxfordreference.com"/>

De Beauvoir first worked with [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] and [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], when all three completed their practice teaching requirements at the same secondary school. Although not officially enrolled, she sat in on courses at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in preparation for the ''[[agrégation]]'' in philosophy, a highly competitive postgraduate examination which serves as a national ranking of students. It was while studying for the ''agrégation'' that she met ''École Normale'' students [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Paul Nizan]], and [[René Maheu]] (who gave her the lasting nickname "Castor", or beaver).<ref name = "IEP Biography" />  The jury for the ''agrégation'' narrowly awarded Sartre first place instead of de Beauvoir, who placed second and, at age 21, was the youngest person ever to pass the exam.<ref>Menand, Louis.

Writing of her youth in ''Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter'' she said:
"...my father's individualism and pagan ethical standards were in complete contrast to the rigidly moral conventionalism of my mother's teaching. This disequilibrium, which made my life a kind of endless disputation, is the main reason why I became an intellectual."<ref>''Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter'', Book One</ref>

==Middle years==
From 1929 to 1943, de Beauvoir taught at the [[lycée]] level until she could support herself solely on the earnings of her writings. She taught at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Lycée Montgrand|fr}} ([[Marseille]]), the {{Interlanguage link multi|Lycée Jeanne-d'Arc (Rouen)|fr}}, the {{Interlanguage link multi|Lycée Molière (Paris)|fr}} (1936–39).<ref>Kelly Oliver (ed.), ''French Feminism Reader'', Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, 2000, p. 1; ''Bulletin 2006 de l'Association amicale des anciens et anciennes élèves du lycée Molière'', 2006, page 22.</ref>

During October 1929, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and de Beauvoir became a couple and, after they were confronted by her father, Sartre asked her to marry him.<ref>Bair, pp. 155–156</ref> One day while they were sitting on a bench outside the Louvre, he said, "Let's sign a two-year lease".<ref>Bair, p. 157</ref> Near the end of her life, de Beauvoir said, "Marriage was impossible. I had no [[dowry]]." So they entered a lifelong relationship.<ref>Bair, p. 156</ref> De Beauvoir chose never to marry and did not set up a joint household with Sartre.<ref name=Schneir /> She never had children.<ref name=Schneir>{{cite book|author=Schneir, Miriam|title=Feminism in Our Time|year=1994|publisher=Vintage Books|page=5|isbn=0-679-74508-4}}</ref> This gave her time to earn an advanced academic degree, to join political causes, to travel, to write, to teach and to have lovers (both male and female; the latter often shared).{{ref}}<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jun/10/gender.politicsphilosophyandsociety |location=London |work=The Guardian  | first=Lisa | last=Appignanesi | title=Our relationship was the greatest achievement of my life | date=10 June 2005}}</ref>
[[File:Sartre and de Beauvoir at Balzac Memorial.jpg|thumb|Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir at the Balzac Memorial]]

Sartre and de Beauvoir always read each other's work. Debate continues about the extent to which they influenced each other in their existentialist works, such as Sartre's ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' and de Beauvoir's ''She Came to Stay'' and "Phenomenology and Intent". However, recent studies of de Beauvoir's work focus on influences other than Sartre, including [[G. W. F. Hegel|Hegel]] and Leibniz.<ref name="plato.stanford" /> The [[Neo-Hegelianism|Neo-Hegelian]] revival led by [[Alexandre Kojève]] and [[Jean Hyppolite]] in the 1930s inspired a whole generation of French thinkers, including Beauvoir and Sartre, to discover Hegel's ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]''.<ref>Ursula Tidd, ''Simone de Beauvoir'', Psychology Press, p. 19.</ref><ref>Nancy Bauer, ''Simone de Beauvoir: Philosophy, and Feminism'', Columbia University Press, 2012, p. 86.</ref>

==Personal life==
[[Nigel Rodgers]] and [[Mel Thompson]] in their 2005 book ''[[Philosophers Behaving Badly]]'' say de Beauvoir had a very turbulent, often scandalous life. Although de Beauvoir had a long time relationship with Sartre, she was known to have a number of female lovers. The nature of some of these relationships, some of which she began with underage students while working as a professor, later led to a biographical controversy.<ref>''A dangerous liaison: Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre'', By Carole Seymour-Jones (London 2008), pages 216 and 274</ref><ref>''[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/sex-and-philosophy-rethinking-de-beauvoir-and-sartre-by-edward-fullbrook-and-kate-fullbrookbr-a-dangerous-liaison-by-carole-seymourjones-832532.html New studies agree that Beauvoir is eclipsing Sartre as a philosopher and writer]'', ''The Independent'', by Lesley McDowell, Sunday, 25 May 2008</ref><ref>''Contingent loves: Simone de Beauvoir and sexuality'', By Melanie Hawthorne (London, 2000), pages 65–78</ref><ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/starttheweek_20080421.shtml BBC Radio 4 Start the Week] BBC Radio 4, Andrew Marr, 21 April 2008</ref> Former student [[Bianca Lamblin]] (originally Bianca Bienenfeld) wrote in her book ''Mémoires d'une jeune fille dérangée'' that, while she was a student at Lycée Molière, she had been sexually exploited by her teacher de Beauvoir, who was in her 30s at the time.<ref>''Mémoires d'une jeune fille dérangée'' (1994, LGF – Livre de Poche; {{ISBN|978-2-253-13593-7}}/2006, Balland; {{ISBN|978-2-7158-0994-9}})</ref> In 1943, de Beauvoir was suspended from her teaching job, due to an accusation that she had seduced her 17-year-old lycée pupil [[Natalie Sorokin]]e in 1939.<ref>''Tête-à-tête: Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre'', Hazel Rowley, HarperCollins, 2005, page 130-35, {{ISBN|0-06-052059-0}};{{ISBN|978-0-06-052059-5}}</ref> Sorokine's parents laid formal charges against de Beauvoir for debauching a minor and as a result she had her license to teach in France permanently revoked.<ref>''Intellectuals: From Marx and Tolstoy to Sartre and Chomsky'', Paul Johnson, Harper Perrenial, 1988, page 238-238, {{ISBN|978-0-06-125317-1}}</ref> She and Jean-Paul Sartre developed a pattern, which they called the "trio", in which de Beauvoir would seduce her students and then pass them on to Sartre.<ref>[http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/19/savile-beauvoir-and-the-charms-of-the-nymph/?_r=0]</ref> De Beauvoir and Sartre would both take part in political campaigns to abolish the age of consent laws for sexual relationships in France.<ref name= Krizman>"''[[Sexual Morality and the Law]]''", Chapter 16 of ''Politics, Philosophy, Culture: Interviews and Other Writings 1977-1984''.

==Notable works==

===''She Came to Stay''===
De Beauvoir published her first novel ''[[She Came to Stay]]'' in 1943.<ref>[http://www.iep.utm.edu/beauvoir/]</ref>  It is a fictionalised chronicle of her and Sartre's sexual relationship with [[Olga Kosakiewicz]] and [[Wanda Kosakiewicz]]. Olga was one of her students in the Rouen secondary school where de Beauvoir taught during the early 1930s. She grew fond of Olga. Sartre tried to pursue Olga but she rejected him, so he began a relationship with her sister Wanda. Upon his death, Sartre was still supporting Wanda. He also supported Olga for years, until she met and married [[Jacques-Laurent Bost]], a lover of de Beauvoir.

In the novel, set just before the outbreak of [[World War II]], de Beauvoir creates one character from the complex relationships of Olga and Wanda. The fictionalised versions of Beauvoir and Sartre have a [[ménage à trois]] with the young woman. The novel also delves into de Beauvoir and Sartre's complex relationship and how it was affected by the ménage à trois.

''She Came to Stay'' was followed by many others, including ''[[The Blood of Others]]'', which explores the nature of individual responsibility, telling a love story between two young French students participating in the [[French Resistance|Resistance]] in World War II.<ref name="iep.utm.edu">http://www.iep.utm.edu/beauvoir/ Simone de Beauvoir</ref>

===Existentialist ethics===
In 1944 de Beauvoir wrote her first philosophical essay, ''Pyrrhus et Cinéas'', a discussion of an existentialist ethics. She continued her exploration of existentialism through her second essay ''[[The Ethics of Ambiguity]]'' (1947); it is perhaps the most accessible entry into [[Existentialism|French existentialism]]. In the essay, de Beauvoir clears up some inconsistencies that many, Sartre included, have found in major existentialist works such as ''Being and Nothingness''. In ''The Ethics of Ambiguity'', de Beauvoir confronts the existentialist dilemma of absolute freedom vs. the constraints of circumstance.<ref name="plato.stanford" />

===''Les Temps modernes''===
{{main|Les Temps modernes}}
At the end of World War II, de Beauvoir and Sartre edited ''[[Les Temps modernes]]'', a political journal which Sartre founded along with [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] and others. De Beauvoir used ''Les Temps Modernes'' to promote her own work and explore her ideas on a small scale before fashioning essays and books. De Beauvoir remained an editor until her death.

===Sexuality, existentialist feminism and ''The Second Sex''===
''[[The Second Sex]]'', first published in French as ''Le Deuxième Sexe'', turns the existentialist mantra that ''[[existence precedes essence]]'' into a feminist one: “One is not born but becomes a woman.”<ref>Beauvoir, The Second Sex, 267</ref> With this famous phrase, Beauvoir first articulated what has come to be known as the sex-gender distinction, that is, the distinction between biological sex and the social and historical construction of gender and its attendant stereotypes.<ref>https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-gender/</ref> The fundamental source of women's oppression, Beauvoir notes, is its historical and social construction as the quintessential Other.<ref>https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/beauvoir/#SecSexWomOth</ref>

De Beauvoir defines women as the “second sex” because women are defined in relation to men. Aristotle referred that women are “female by virtue of a certain lack of qualities.” De Beauvoir also points out that St. Thomas referred to the woman as the “imperfect man", the "incidental” being.<ref name="marxists.org">[https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/ethics/de-beauvoir/2nd-sex/introduction.htm]</ref> De Beauvoir asserted that women are as capable of choice as men, and thus can choose to elevate themselves, moving beyond the '[[immanence]]' to which they were previously resigned and reaching '[[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]]', a position in which one takes responsibility for oneself and the world, where one chooses one's freedom.

Chapters of ''The Second Sex'' were originally published in ''Les Temps modernes'',<ref>Appignanesi 2005, p. 82</ref> in June 1949. The second volume came a few months after the first in France.<ref>Appignanesi 2005, p. 89</ref> It was very quickly published in America due to the quick translation by [[Howard Parshley]], as prompted by [[Blanche Knopf]], wife of publisher [[Alfred A. Knopf]]. Because Parshley had only a basic familiarity with the French language, and a minimal understanding of philosophy (he was a professor of biology at [[Smith College]]), much of de Beauvoir's book was mistranslated or inappropriately cut, distorting her intended message.<ref name="Moi, Toril 2002">Moi, Toril 'While We Wait: The English Translation of "The Second Sex" in Signs 27(4) (summer, 2002), pp., 1005–1035.</ref> For years, Knopf prevented the introduction of a more accurate retranslation of de Beauvoir's work, declining all proposals despite the efforts of existentialist scholars.<ref name="Moi, Toril 2002"/> Only in 2009 was there a second translation, to mark the 60th anniversary of the original publication. Constance Borde and Sheila Malovany-Chevallier produced the first integral translation in 2010, reinstating a third of the original work.<ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/books/review-the-second-sex-by-simone-de-beauvoir/article1615327 ''Globe and Mail'' review]</ref>

In the chapter "Woman: Myth and Reality" of ''The Second Sex'',<ref>Beauvoir, Simone de. "Woman: Myth and Reality".<br>** in Jacobus, Lee A. (ed.). ''A World of Ideas''. Bedford/St. Martins, Boston 2006. 780–795.<br>** in Prince, Althea, and Susan Silva Wayne. ''Feminisms and Womanisms: A Women's Studies Reader''. Women's Press, Toronto 2004 p.&nbsp;59–65.</ref> de Beauvoir argued that men had made women the "Other" in society by application of a false aura of "mystery" around them. She argued that men used this as an excuse not to understand women or their problems and not to help them, and that this stereotyping was always done in societies by the group higher in the hierarchy to the group lower in the hierarchy. She wrote that a similar kind of oppression by hierarchy also happened in other categories of identity, such as race, class and religion, but she claimed that it was nowhere more true than with gender in which men stereotyped women and used it as an excuse to organize society into a [[patriarchy]].

Women who do not follow the domestic norm are looked down upon in society. Beauvoir is explaining that woman referred as “the other.” She states, “What is a woman?’...The fact that I ask it is in itself significant. A man would never get the notion of writing a book on the peculiar situation of the human male. But if I wish to define myself, I must first of all say: ‘I am a woman’; on this truth must be based all further discussion. A man never begins by presenting himself as an individual of a certain sex; it goes without saying that he is a man. […] It would be out of the question to reply: ‘And you think the contrary because you are a man,’ for it is understood that the fact of being a man is no peculiarity.” (34-5) As for man there is no need to define what is to be a man, there is no reason because they identified themselves as the superior part. Man represents both “the positive and the neutral,” which doesn’t need to be explained or defined, and it is self-explanatory. “Thus humanity is male and man defines woman not in relation to herself but as relative to him; she is not regarded as an autonomous being.” (35) Men are the default setting and women are considered a recessive gender. “He is the Subject, he is the Absolute—she is the Other.” (35) It is like an asymmetrical comparison, but masculine and feminine aren’t asymmetrical.

“Are there woman, really? Most assuredly the theory of the eternal feminine still has its adherents who will whisper in your ear: ‘Even in Russia women are still women’; and other erudite persons—sometimes the very same—say with a sigh, ‘Woman is losing her way, woman is lost.’” (34) De Beauvoir refers, to the “eternal feminine,” it can be what define some kind of spiritual being that connect all women to each other.<ref name="marxists.org"/>

De Beauvoir argued that women have historically been considered deviant, abnormal. She said that even [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] considered men to be the ideal toward which women should aspire. De Beauvoir said that this attitude limited women's success by maintaining the perception that they were a deviation from the normal, and were always outsiders attempting to emulate "normality". She believed that for feminism to move forward, this assumption must be set aside.

Despite her contributions to the feminist movement, especially the French women's liberation movement, and her beliefs in women's economic independence and equal education, de Beauvoir was initially reluctant to call herself a feminist.''<ref name="oxfordreference.com"/> ''However, after observing the resurgence of the feminist movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s, de Beauvoir stated she no longer believed a socialist revolution to be sufficient enough to bring about women's liberation. She publicly declared herself a feminist in 1972 in an interview with ''[[Le Nouvel Observateur]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Fallaize|first=Elizabeth|title=Simone de Beauvoir : a critical reader|year=1998|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415147033|page=6|edition=Digital print }}</ref>

=== ''The Mandarins'' ===
Published in 1954, ''The Mandarins'' is set after the end of World War II and won her France's highest literary prize, the ''[[Prix Goncourt]]''. The book follows the personal lives of philosophers and friends among Sartre's and de Beauvoir's intimate circle, including her relationship with American writer [[Nelson Algren]], to whom the book was dedicated. Algren was outraged by the frank way de Beauvoir described their sexual experiences in both ''The Mandarins'' and her autobiographies.[[File:Algren house Miller.jpg|thumb|Dunes cottage where Algren and de Beauvoir summered in [[Miller Beach]], Indiana]] Algren vented his outrage when reviewing American translations of de Beauvoir's work. Much material bearing on this episode in de Beauvoir's life, including her love letters to Algren, entered the public domain only after her death.

==Later years==
[[File:Núñez-Beauvoir-Sartre-Che Guevara.jpg|thumb|left| [[Antonio Núñez Jiménez]], de Beauvoir, [[Sartre]] and [[Che Guevara]] in Cuba, 1960]]
De Beauvoir wrote popular travel diaries about time spent in the United States <ref>de Beauvoir, "America Day by Day", Carol Cosman (Translator) and Douglas Brinkley (Foreword), Berkeley: University of California Press, 1999. {{ISBN|9780520210677}}</ref> and China and published essays and fiction rigorously, especially throughout the 1950s and 1960s. She published several volumes of short stories, including ''The Woman Destroyed'', which, like some of her other later work, deals with aging.

1980 saw the publication of ''[[When Things of the Spirit Come First]]'', a set of short stories centred around and based upon women important to her earlier years.<ref name="iep.utm.edu"/> Though written long before the novel ''She Came to Stay'', de Beauvoir did not at the time consider the stories worth publishing, allowing some forty years to pass before doing so.

[[Sartre]] and [[Merleau-Ponty]] had a longstanding feud, which led Merleau-Ponty to leave ''Les Temps Modernes''. De Beauvoir sided with Sartre and ceased to associate with Merleau-Ponty. In de Beauvoir's later years, she hosted the journal's editorial meetings in her flat and contributed more than Sartre, whom she often had to force to offer his opinions.

De Beauvoir also notably wrote a four-volume autobiography, consisting of: ''Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter''; ''The Prime of Life''; ''Force of Circumstance'' (sometimes published in two volumes in English translation: ''After the War'' and ''Hard Times''); and ''All Said and Done''.<ref name="iep.utm.edu"/>

In the 1970s de Beauvoir became active in France's [[women's liberation movement]]. She wrote and signed the [[Manifesto of the 343]] in 1971, a manifesto that included a list of famous women who claimed to have had an abortion, then illegal in France. Some argue most of the women had not had abortions, including Beauvoir, but given the secrecy surrounding the issue, this cannot be known.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Signatories were diverse as [[Catherine Deneuve]], [[Delphine Seyrig]] and de Beauvoir's sister Poupette. In 1974, abortion was legalised in France.

Her 1970 long essay [[La Vieillesse]] (''The Coming of Age'') is a rare instance of an intellectual meditation on the decline and solitude all humans experience if they do not die before about the age of 60.

In an interview with [[Betty Friedan]], de Beauvoir said: "No, we don’t believe that any woman should have this choice. No woman should be authorised to stay at home to bring up her children. Society should be totally different. Women should not have that choice, precisely because if there is such a choice, too many women will make that one. It is a way of forcing women in a certain direction."<ref>“A Dialogue with Simone de Beauvoir,” in Betty Friedan, It Changed My Life: Writings on the Women’s Movement (New York: Random House, 1976), pp. 311–12
</ref>

In about 1976 de Beauvoir and Sylvie Le Bon made a trip to New York City in the United States to visit [[Kate Millett]] on her farm.<ref>Appignanesi 2005, p. 160</ref>
[[Image:Sartre+Beauvoir grave.JPG|right|thumb|De Beauvoir's and Sartre's grave at the [[Cimetière du Montparnasse]]]]

In 1981 she wrote ''La Cérémonie Des Adieux'' (''A Farewell to Sartre''), a painful account of Sartre's last years. In the opening of ''Adieux'', de Beauvoir notes that it is the only major published work of hers which Sartre did not read before its publication.

She contributed the piece "Feminism - alive, well, and in constant danger" to the 1984 anthology ''[[Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women's Movement Anthology]]'', edited by [[Robin Morgan]].<ref name="global">{{cite web|url=https://catalog.vsc.edu/lscfind/Record/154795/TOC#tabnav |title=Table of Contents: Sisterhood is global : |publisher=Catalog.vsc.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-10-15}}</ref>

After Sartre died in 1980, de Beauvoir published his letters to her with edits to spare the feelings of people in their circle who were still living. After de Beauvoir's death, Sartre's adopted daughter and literary heir Arlette Elkaïm would not let many of Sartre's letters be published in unedited form. Most of Sartre's letters available today have de Beauvoir's edits, which include a few omissions but mostly the use of pseudonyms. De Beauvoir's adopted daughter and literary heir [[Sylvie Le Bon-de Beauvoir|Sylvie Le Bon]], unlike Elkaïm, published de Beauvoir's unedited letters to both Sartre and Algren.

De Beauvoir died of [[pneumonia]] on April 14, 1986 in Paris, aged 78.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/women/article-9014010]</ref> She is buried next to Sartre at the Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris.
