'''William Hugh Woodin''' (born April 23, 1955) is an American mathematician and [[set theory|set theorist]] at [[Harvard University]]. He has made many notable contributions to the theory of [[inner model]]s and [[determinacy]]. A type of [[large cardinal]], the [[Woodin cardinal]], bears his name.

==Biography==

Born in [[Tucson]], [[Arizona]], Woodin earned his [[Ph.D.]] from the University of California, Berkeley in 1984 under [[Robert M. Solovay]]. His dissertation title was ''Discontinuous Homomorphisms of C''(''Omega'') ''and Set Theory''. He served as [[chairman|chair]] of the Berkeley mathematics department for the 2002–2003 academic year. Woodin is a managing editor of the [[Journal of Mathematical Logic]]. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2000.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter W|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterW.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=June 3, 2011}}</ref>

He is the great-grandson of [[William Hartman Woodin]], former [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]].

==Work==
He has done work on the theory of generic multiverses and the related concept of [[Ω-logic]], which suggested an argument that the [[continuum hypothesis]] is either undecidable or false in the sense of [[mathematical platonism]]. Woodin criticizes this view arguing that it leads to a counterintuitive reduction in which all truths in the set theoretical universe can be decided from a small part of it. He claims that these and related mathematical results lead (intuitively) to the conclusion that Continuum Hypothesis has a [[truth value]] and the Platonistic approach is reasonable.

Woodin now predicts that there should be a way of constructing an inner model for almost all known large cardinals, which he calls the Ultimate L and which would have similar properties as [[Constructible_universe|Gödel's constructible universe]]. In particular, the Continuum Hypothesis would be true in this universe.{{fact|date=April 2013}}<ref>{{cite journal|author=Wolchover, Natalie|title=To Settle Infinity Dispute, a New Law of Logic|journal=[[Quanta Magazine]]|date=26 November 2013|url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/20131126-to-settle-infinity-question-a-new-law-of-logic/}}</ref>
