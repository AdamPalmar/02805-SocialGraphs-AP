'''Paul Alexandre René Janet''' (30 April 1823 – 4 October 1899) was a [[France|French]] [[philosopher]] and writer.

==Biography==
Born in [[Paris, France|Paris]], he became professor of [[moral philosophy]] at [[University of Bourges|Bourges]] (1845–1848) and [[Strasbourg]] (1848–1857), and of logic at the ''lycée Louis-le-Grand'', Paris (1857–1864). In 1864 he was appointed to the chair of philosophy at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], and elected a member of the academy of moral and political sciences.

He wrote widely on philosophy, politics and ethics, on idealistic lines: ''La Famille'', ''Histoire de la philosophie dans l'antiquité et dans le temps moderne'', ''Histoire de la science politique'', ''Philosophie de la Revolution Française'', etc. However, in the opinion of [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]], these writings are not characterised by much originality of thought. In philosophy he was a follower of [[Victor Cousin]], and through him of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]]. His principal work, ''Théorie de la morale'', owes much to [[Immanuel Kant]].
