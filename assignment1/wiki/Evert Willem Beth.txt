'''Evert Willem Beth''' (7 July 1908 &ndash; 12 April 1964) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[philosopher]] and [[logician]], whose work principally concerned the [[foundations of mathematics]].

== Biography ==
Beth was born in [[Almelo]], a small town in the eastern [[Netherlands]].  His father had studied [[mathematics]] and [[physics]] at the [[Universiteit van Amsterdam|University of Amsterdam]], where he had been awarded a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]]. Evert Beth studied the same subjects at [[Utrecht University]], but then also studied [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]]. His 1935 [[Ph.D.]] was in philosophy.

In 1946, he became professor of [[logic]] and the foundations of mathematics in [[Amsterdam]].  Apart from two brief interruptions &ndash; a stint in 1951 as a research assistant to [[Alfred Tarski]], and in 1957 as a visiting professor at [[Johns Hopkins University]] &ndash; he held the post in Amsterdam continuously until his death in 1964.  His was the first academic post in his country in logic and the foundations of mathematics, and during this time he contributed actively to international cooperation in establishing logic as an academic discipline.

In 1953 he became member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&aId=PE00002175 |title=Evert Willem Beth (1908 - 1964) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=20 July 2015}}</ref>

He died in [[Amsterdam]].

== Contributions to logic ==

=== Definition theorem ===
{{expand section|date=April 2014}}
The definition theorem states that a predicate (or function or constant) is implicitly definable if and only if it is explicitly definable. Further explanation is provided under [[Beth definability]]

=== Semantic tableaux ===
[[Method of analytic tableaux|Semantic tableaux]] are a proof method for [[formal system]]s. Cf. [[Gentzen]]'s [[natural deduction]] and [[sequent calculus]], or even [[J. Alan Robinson]]'s [[First-order resolution|resolution]] and [[David Hilbert|Hilbert's]] axiomatic systems.  It is considered by many to be intuitively simple, particularly for students not acquainted with the study of logic ([[Wilfrid Hodges]] for example presents semantic tableaux in his introductory textbook, ''Logic'', and [[Melvin Fitting]] does the same in his presentation of first-order logic for [[computer science|computer scientists]], ''First-order logic and automated theorem proving'').

One starts out with the intention of proving that a certain set <math> \Gamma \,</math> of formulae imply another formula <math> \varphi\, </math>, given a set of rules determined by the semantics of the formulae's [[Logical connective|connectives]] (and quantifiers, in [[first-order logic]]).  The method is to assume the concurrent truth of every member of <math> \Gamma \,</math> and of <math> \neg \varphi </math> (the negation of <math> \varphi\, </math>), and then to apply the rules to branch this list into a tree-like structure of (simpler) formulae until every possible branch contains a contradiction.  At this point it will have been established that <math> \Gamma \cup \{ \neg \varphi \} </math> is inconsistent, and thus that the formulae of <math> \Gamma\, </math> together imply <math> \varphi \,</math>.

=== Beth models ===
{{expand section|date=April 2014}}
These are a class of relational models for non-classical logic (cf. [[Kripke semantics]]).
