==Biography==

===Early life===
Frank Herbert was born on October 8, 1920, in [[Tacoma, Washington]], to Frank Patrick Herbert, Sr. and Eileen (McCarthy) Herbert. Because of a poor home environment, he ran away from home in 1938 to live with an aunt and uncle in [[Salem, Oregon]].<ref name="salem">[Herbert, Brian.

He served in the U.S. Navy's [[Seabees]] for six months as a photographer during [[World War II]], then he was given a medical discharge. He married Flora Parkinson in [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro]], California in 1940. They had a daughter, Penny (b. February 16, 1942), but divorced in 1945.

After the war Herbert attended the [[University of Washington]], where he met Beverly Ann Stuart at a creative writing class in 1946. They were the only students who had sold any work for publication; Herbert had sold two [[pulp magazine|pulp]] adventure stories to magazines, the first to ''[[Esquire Magazine|Esquire]]'' in 1945, and Stuart had sold a story to ''Modern Romance'' magazine. They married in [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]] on June 20, 1946 and had two sons, [[Brian Herbert|Brian Patrick Herbert]] (b. June 29, 1947, Seattle, Washington) and Bruce Calvin Herbert (b. June 26, 1951, [[Santa Rosa, California]] d.

In 1949 Herbert and his wife moved to California to work on the ''[[Santa Rosa Press-Democrat]]''. Here they befriended the psychologists Ralph and Irene Slattery. The Slatterys introduced Herbert to the work of several thinkers who would influence his writing, including [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Carl Jung|Jung]], [[Karl Jaspers|Jaspers]] and [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]; they also familiarized Herbert with [[Zen Buddhism]].<ref>Irene Slattery had been a former student
of Jung's in Zurich. See Touponce, William F. (1988), Frank Herbert, Boston, Massachusetts: Twayne Publishers imprint, G. K. Hall & Co, {{ISBN|0-8057-7514-5}} (p. 9-10).</ref>

Herbert did not graduate from the university; according to his son Brian, he wanted to study only what interested him and so did not complete the required curriculum. He returned to journalism and worked at the ''[[Seattle Star]]'' and the ''[[Oregon Statesman]]''. He was a writer and editor for the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'s'' ''California Living'' magazine for a decade.

In a 1973 interview, Herbert stated that he had been reading science fiction "about ten years" before he
began writing in the genre, and he listed his favorite authors as [[H. G. Wells]], [[Robert A. Heinlein]], [[Poul Anderson]] and [[Jack Vance]].<ref name="vertex">"Well, I did read some Heinlein. I shouldn't really tie it down to ten years because I had read H. G. Wells. I'd read Vance, Jack Vance, and I became acquainted with Jack Vance about that time&nbsp;...

Herbert's first science fiction story, "Looking for Something", was published in the April 1952 issue of ''[[Startling Stories]]'', then a monthly edited by Samuel Mines. Three more of his stories appeared in 1954 issues of ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' and ''[[Amazing Stories]]''.<ref name="isfdb" /> His career as a novelist began in 1955 with the serial publication of ''Under Pressure'' in ''Astounding'' from November 1955; afterward it was issued as a book by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], ''[[The Dragon in the Sea]]''.<ref name="isfdb" /> The story explored sanity and madness in the environment of a 21st-century submarine and predicted worldwide conflicts over [[petroleum|oil]] consumption and production.<ref name="gm">[[Gina Macdonald]], "Herbert, Frank (Patrick)", in ''[[Twentieth-Century Science-Fiction Writers]]'' by [[Curtis C.

During this time Herbert also worked as a [[speechwriter]] for [[Republicanism in the United States|Republican]] senator [[Guy Cordon]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Richards|first1=Linda L.|title=The Sons of DUne|url=http://www.januarymagazine.com/profiles/duneprofile.html|website=januarymagazine.com|publisher=January Magazine|accessdate=August 31, 2014}}</ref>

[[File:USA Oregon Dunes.jpg|thumb|275px|The [[Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area|Oregon Dunes]], near [[Florence, Oregon]], served as an inspiration for the ''Dune'' saga.]]

=== ''Dune'' ===
Herbert began researching ''Dune'' in 1959. He was able to devote himself wholeheartedly to his writing career because his wife returned to work full-time as an advertising writer for department stores, becoming the breadwinner during the 1960s. He later told [[Willis E. McNelly]] that the novel originated when he was supposed to do a magazine article on sand dunes in the [[Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area|Oregon Dunes]] near [[Florence, Oregon]]. He became too involved and ended up with far more raw material than needed for an article. The article was never written, but instead planted the seed that led to ''Dune''.

''Dune'' took six years of research and writing to complete and it was much longer than commercial science fiction of the time was supposed to run. ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Analog]]'' (the renamed ''Astounding'', still edited by [[John W. Campbell]]) published it in two parts comprising eight installments, "Dune World" from December 1963 and "Prophet of Dune" in 1965.<ref name="isfdb" /> It was then rejected by nearly twenty book publishers. One editor prophetically wrote, "I might be making the mistake of the decade, but&nbsp;...".<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/place-london/A42130199|title = BBC – h2g2|date = October 28, 2008|accessdate = May 26, 2014|website = Edited guide entry, Frank Patrick Herbert, Jr. – Author|publisher = British Broadcasting Company|last = |first = }}</ref>

Sterling E. Lanier, an editor of [[Chilton Publishing Company|Chilton Book Company]] (known mainly for its auto-repair manuals) had read the Dune serials and offered a  $7,500 advance plus future royalties for the rights to publish them as a hardcover book.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frankherbert.org/wormsblog/page051.html |title=Sandworms of Dune Blog |publisher=Frankherbert.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-27}}</ref> Herbert rewrote much of his text.<ref name="kirjasto"/> ''Dune'' was soon a critical success.<ref name=":0" /> It won the [[Nebula Award]] for Best Novel in 1965 and shared the [[Hugo Award]] in 1966 with ''[[...And Call Me Conrad]]'' by [[Roger Zelazny]].<ref name="SFAwards" /> ''Dune'' was the first major ecological science fiction novel, embracing a multitude of sweeping, interrelated themes and multiple character viewpoints, a method that ran through all Herbert's mature work.

''Dune'' was not immediately a bestseller. By 1968 Herbert had made $20,000 from it, far more than most science fiction novels of the time were generating, but not enough to let him take up full-time writing. However, the publication of ''Dune'' did open doors for him. He was the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'s'' education writer from 1969 to 1972 and lecturer in [[Bachelor of General Studies|general studies]] and [[integrative learning|interdisciplinary studies]] at the University of Washington (1970–1972). He worked in [[Vietnam]] and [[Pakistan]] as social and ecological consultant in 1972. In 1973 he was director-photographer of the television show ''The Tillers''.<ref>Herbert, Brian. ''Dreamer of Dune : The Biography of Frank Herbert''. New York: Tor Books, 2003, pg. 257–258, {{ISBN|0-765-30646-8}} "[Frank Herbert completed] a half-hour documentary film based upon field work he had done with [[Roy Prosterman]] in Pakistan [and] Vietnam ...

By 1972, Herbert retired from newspaper writing and became a full-time fiction writer. During the 1970s and 1980s, Herbert enjoyed considerable commercial success as an author. He divided his time between homes in Hawaii and [[Washington (state)|Washington]]'s [[Olympic Peninsula]]; his home in [[Port Townsend, Washington|Port Townsend]]<ref>{{citation|title=Frank Herbert: Science Fiction Author; A Plowboy Interview with Frank Herbert, science fiction's yellow journalist and a homesteading techno-peasant|url=http://www.motherearthnews.com/Nature-Community/1981-05-01/Interview-With-A-Science-Fiction-Author.aspx|publisher=[[Mother Earth News]]|date=May–June 1981|accessdate=2011-01-10}}</ref> on the peninsula was intended to be an "ecological demonstration project".<ref>{{Citation|

=== Success, family changes, and death ===
Herbert's change in fortune was shadowed by tragedy. In 1974, Beverly underwent an operation for cancer. She lived ten more years, but her health was adversely affected by the surgery.<ref>Herbert, Frank P. (1987), ''Chapterhouse: Dune'', New York City: The Berkley Publishing Group, [[Ace Books]], pg. 436, {{ISBN|0-441-10267-0}}. "It was typical of her that she wanted me to call the radiologist whose treatment in 1974 was the proximate cause of her death and thank him..."</ref> During this period, Herbert was the featured speaker at the Octocon II science fiction convention at the El Rancho Tropicana in Santa Rosa, California in October 1978; in 1979, he met anthropologist James Funaro with whom he conceived the [[Contact Conference]]. Beverly Herbert died on February 7, 1984, the same year that ''[[Heretics of Dune]]'' was published; in his afterword to 1985's ''[[Chapterhouse: Dune]]'', Frank Herbert wrote a eulogy for her.

In 1983, British [[heavy metal (music)|heavy metal]] band [[Iron Maiden (band)|Iron Maiden]] requested permission from Herbert's publisher to name a song on their album ''[[Piece of Mind]]'' after ''Dune'', but were told that the author had a strong distaste for their style of music. They instead titled the song "To Tame a Land".

1984 was a tumultuous year in Herbert's life. During this same year of his wife's death, his career took off with the release of [[David Lynch]]'s film version of ''[[Dune (film)|Dune]]''. Despite high expectations, a big-budget production design and an A-list cast, the movie drew mostly poor reviews in the United States. However, despite a disappointing response in the USA, the film was a critical and commercial success in Europe and Japan.<ref name="kirjasto">{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/fherbert.htm |title=Frank Herbert |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://greencardamom.github.io/BooksAndWriters/fherbert.htm |archivedate=February 10, 2015 |dead-url=yes}}</ref>

After Beverly's death, Herbert married Theresa Shackleford in 1985, the year he published ''Chapterhouse: Dune'', which tied up many of the saga's story threads. This would be Herbert's final single work (the collection ''[[Eye (short story collection)|Eye]]'' was published that year, and ''Man of Two Worlds'' was published in 1986). He died of a massive [[pulmonary embolism]] while recovering from surgery for [[pancreatic cancer]] on February 11, 1986 in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], Wisconsin age 65. He was raised a [[Catholic]] but adopted [[Zen Buddhism]] as an adult.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adherents.com/people/ph/Frank_Herbert.html |title=The religion of Frank Herbert, leading science fiction writer |publisher=Adherents.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-27}}</ref>

=== Criticism of government ===
Herbert was a strong critic of the [[Soviet Union]]. He was a distant relative of the controversial [[Republicanism in the United States|Republican]] senator, [[Joseph McCarthy]], whom he referred to as "Cousin Joe." Herbert was appalled to learn of McCarthy's blacklisting of suspected Communists from working in certain careers and believed that he was endangering essential freedoms of citizens of the United States.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Herbert |first1=Brian |title=Dreamer of Dune: The Biography of Frank Herbert |date=2003 |publisher=MacMillan |page=91 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hmg0YFP52XcC&pg=PA91&lpg=PA91&dq=frank+herbert+like+mccarthy&source=bl&ots=PUh2YwysYk&sig=wM8sMw9AckJ35wkgvHk0sdQbh1k&hl=en&sa=X&ei=cHTeVK-LNoTIsQS_qIHADg&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=frank%20herbert%20like%20mccarthy&f=false |accessdate=February 13, 2015}}</ref> Herbert believed that governments lie to protect themselves and that, following the infamous [[Watergate scandal]], President [[Richard Nixon]] had unwittingly taught an important lesson in not trusting government.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Herbert |first1=Brian |title=Dreamer of Dune: The Biography of Frank Herbert |date=2003 |publisher=MacMillan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z3SF08iQGpEC&pg=PT164&lpg=PT164&dq=frank+herbert+richard+nixon+provided+proof&source=bl&ots=rlkBhD4OR8&sig=gERk-ToHchMOX7z8kAGK6d2k55A&hl=en&sa=X&ei=03feVKf6KcXlsASPnIDgCg&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=frank%20herbert%20richard%20nixon%20provided%20proof&f=false |accessdate=February 13, 2015}}</ref>

In ''Chapterhouse: Dune'', he wrote:
{{cquote|All governments suffer a recurring problem: Power attracts pathological personalities. It is not that power corrupts but that it is magnetic to the corruptible. Such people have a tendency to become drunk on violence, a condition to which they are quickly addicted.}}

==Ideas and themes==

{{Quotation|I think science fiction does help, and it points in very interesting directions. It points in relativistic directions. It says that we have the imagination for these other opportunities, these other choices. We tend to tie ourselves down to limited choices. We say, "Well, the only answer is&nbsp;..." or, "If you would just&nbsp;...". Whatever follows these two statements narrows the choices right there. It gets the vision right down close to the ground so that you don't see anything happening outside. Humans tend not to see over a long range. Now we are required, in these generations, to have a longer range view of what we inflict on the world around us. This is where, I think, science fiction is helping. I don't think that the mere writing of such a book as ''[[Brave New World]]'' or ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four|1984]]'' prevents those things which are portrayed in those books from happening. But I do think they alert us to that possibility and make that possibility less likely. They make us aware that we may be going in that direction.|Frank Herbert}}

Frank Herbert used his science fiction novels to explore complex<ref>"With its blend (or sometimes clash) of complex intellectual discourse and Byzantine intrigue, ''Dune'' provided a template for FH's more significant later works. Sequels soon began to appear which carried on the arguments of the original in testingly <!-- ? --> various manners and with an intensity of discourse seldom encountered in the sf field. ''Dune Messiah'' (1969) elaborates the intrigue at the cost of other elements, but ''Children of Dune'' (1976) recaptures much of the strength of the original work and addresses another recurrent theme in FH's work – the evolution of Man, in this case into SUPERMAN;..."

The underlying thrust of his work was a fascination with the question of human survival and evolution. Herbert has attracted a sometimes fanatical fan base, many of whom have tried to read everything he wrote, fiction or non-fiction, and see Herbert as something of an authority on the subject matters of his books. Indeed, such was the devotion of some of his readers that Herbert was at times asked if he was founding a [[cult]],<ref name="Genesis">{{cite web|last=Herbert|first=Frank|url=http://www.frankherbert.org/news/genesis.html |title=''Dune'' Genesis |accessdate=February 14, 2014 |publisher=FrankHerbert.org|work=[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]]|date=July 1980 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107220342/http://www.frankherbert.org/news/genesis.html |archivedate=January 7, 2012}}</ref> something he was very much against.

There are a number of key themes in Herbert's work:
* A concern with leadership. He explored the human tendency to slavishly follow charismatic leaders. He delved into both the flaws and potentials of bureaucracy and government.<ref name="gm" />
* Herbert was the first science fiction author to popularize ideas about ecology<ref>McNeilly, Willis E.

London, Viking, 1988. (pp. 222–24) {{ISBN|0-670-81041-X}} . "Herbert felt strongly about many
causes, particularly ecology&nbsp;..."</ref> and [[systems thinking]].  He stressed the need for humans to think both systematically and long term.<ref>"When I was quite young&nbsp;... I began to suspect there must be flaws in my sense of reality&nbsp;... But I had been produced to focus on objects (things) and not on systems (processes)." Frank Herbert,

* The relationship between religion, politics and [[power (sociology)|power]].<ref>"Frank Herbert's true stroke of
genius consisted&nbsp;... in inviting a way of thinking about humanity, history, religion, and politics as complex and interdependent

* Human survival and evolution: Herbert writes of the [[Fremen]], the [[Sardaukar]], and the [[The Dosadi Experiment|Dosadi]], who are molded by their terrible living conditions into dangerous super races.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}
* Human possibilities and potential: Herbert offered [[Mentat]]s, the [[Bene Gesserit]] and the [[Bene Tleilax]] as different visions of human potential.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}
* The nature of [[sanity]] and [[Mental illness|madness]]. Frank Herbert was interested in the work of [[Thomas Szasz]] and the [[anti-psychiatry]] movement. Often, Herbert poses the question, "''What is sane?''", and while there are clearly insane behaviors and psychopathies as evinced by characters ([[Piter De Vries]] for instance), it is often suggested that normal and abnormal are relative terms which humans are sometimes ill-equipped to apply to one another, especially on the basis of statistical regularity.<ref name="gm" />
* The possible effects and consequences of consciousness-altering chemicals, such as [[Melange (fictional drug)|the spice]] in the ''Dune'' saga, as well as the "Jaspers" fungus in ''[[The Santaroga Barrier]]'', and the [[Kelp]] in the [[Destination: Void universe#WorShip novels|Destination:Void]] sequence.<ref name="gm" />
* How language shapes thought. More specifically, Frank Herbert was influenced by [[Alfred Korzybski]]'s ''[[General Semantics]]''.<ref>O'Reilly, Tim. ''Frank Herbert''. New York, NY: Frederick Ungar Publishing Co., Inc. ,1981. (pp.59–60) {{ISBN|0-8044-2666-X}} .
"Much of the Bene Gesserit technology of consciousness is based on the insights of general semantics, a philosophy and training method developed in the 1930s by [[Alfred Korzybski]]. Herbert had studied general semantics in San Francisco at about the time he was writing ''Dune''. (At one point, he worked as a ghostwriter for a nationally syndicated column by [[S. I. Hayakawa]], one of the foremost proponents of general semantics.)"</ref>
*[[Sociobiology]]. How our instincts unconsciously influence our behavior and society.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}
*[[Learning]], [[teaching]], and [[thinking]].<ref name="gm" />

Frank Herbert refrained from offering his readers formulaic answers to many of the questions he explored.<ref name="gm" />

==Status and influence on science fiction==

''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' and the [[Dune (franchise)|''Dune'' saga]] constitute one of the world's best-selling science fiction series and novels; ''Dune'' in particular has received widespread critical acclaim, winning the [[Nebula Award]] in 1965 and sharing the Hugo Award in 1966, and is frequently considered one of the best science fiction novels ever, if not the best.<ref>"His dominant intellectual impulse was not to mystify or set himself up as a prophet, but the opposite – to turn what powers of analysis he had (and they were considerable) over to his audience. And this impulse is as manifest in ''Dune'', which many people consider the all-time best science fiction novel, as it is in his computer book, ''Without Me You're Nothing''. ppg 2, Touponce 1988</ref> ''[[Locus (magazine)|Locus]]'' subscribers voted it the all-time best SF novel in 1975, again in 1987, and the best "before 1990" in 1998.<ref name="isfdb-dune" />

''Dune'' is considered a landmark novel for a number of reasons:

* ''Dune'' is a landmark of [[soft science fiction]]. Herbert deliberately suppressed technology in his ''Dune'' universe so he could address the future of humanity, rather than the future of humanity's technology. ''Dune'' considers the way humans and their institutions might change over time.<ref>Building Sci-fi Moviescapes: The Science Behind the Fiction by Matt Hanson</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bestsciencefictionbooks.com/authors/frank-herbert.html|title=Frank Herbert Biography Author Page - BestScienceFictionBooks.com|work=bestsciencefictionbooks.com}}</ref>
* ''Dune'' was the first major ecological science fiction novel. Frank Herbert was a great popularizer of scientific ideas; many of his fans credit Frank Herbert for introducing them to philosophy and psychology. In ''Dune'' he helped popularize the term ''ecology'' and some of the field's concepts, vividly imparting a sense of planetary awareness.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} Gerald Jonas explains in ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'': "So completely did Mr. Herbert work out the interactions of man and beast and geography and climate that ''Dune'' became the standard for a new subgenre of 'ecological' science fiction." As popularity of ''Dune'' rose, Herbert embarked on a lecture tour of college campuses, explaining how the environmental concerns of Dune's inhabitants were analogous to our own.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}
* ''Dune'' is considered an epic example of literary world-building. ''[[Library Journal|The Library Journal]]'' reports that "''Dune'' is to science fiction what ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' is to fantasy". [[Arthur C. Clarke]] is quoted as making a similar statement on the back cover of a paper edition of ''Dune''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Herbert|first1=Frank|title=Dune|date=January 1977|publisher=Berkley Publishing Corp|location=USA|isbn=0425-04376-2|page=Back Cover|edition=Berkley Medallion|ref=berk}}</ref> Frank Herbert imagined every facet of his creation. He lovingly included glossaries, quotes, documents, and histories, to bring his universe alive to his readers. No science fiction novel before it had so vividly realized life on another world.<ref name="gm" />

Herbert never again equalled the critical acclaim he received for ''Dune''. Neither his sequels to ''Dune'' nor any of his other books won a Hugo or Nebula Award, although almost all of them were [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Sellers]].{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}<ref name="KJA">Speaking at the 2006 induction of Herbert in the Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Kevin J. Anderson stated that ''Children of Dune'' (1976) "was the first SF novel ever to hit the New York Times bestseller list." [http://www.frankherbert.org/dune7blog/page81.html Dune 7 Blog: Wednesday, June 21, 2006: The Science Fiction Hall of Fame]. By KJA. ''Dune: The Official Website''. Retrieved 2011-07-17. KJA spoke and presented the award to son Brian Herbert.</ref> Some felt that ''Children of Dune'' was almost too literary and too dark to get the recognition it may have deserved; others felt that ''The Dosadi Experiment'' lacked an epic quality that fans had come to expect.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

[[Malcolm Edwards]] in the ''[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction|Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]'' wrote:

<blockquote>Much of Herbert's work makes difficult reading. His ideas were genuinely developed concepts, not merely decorative notions, but they were sometimes embodied in excessively complicated plots and articulated in prose which did not always match the level of thinking [...] His best novels, however, were the work of a speculative intellect with few rivals in modern science fiction.<ref>Malcolm Edwards, "Herbert, Frank" in ''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'', edited by [[John Clute]] and
[[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Peter Nicholls]]. London, Orbit, 1994. {{ISBN|1-85723-124-4}} (p. 558–60).</ref> </blockquote>

In recent years, Frank Herbert's son [[Brian Herbert]] and author [[Kevin J. Anderson]] have added to the [[Dune (franchise)|''Dune'' franchise]], using notes left behind by Frank Herbert and discovered over a decade after his death. Brian Herbert and Anderson have written two prequel [[trilogy|trilogies]] (''[[Prelude to Dune]]'' and ''[[Legends of Dune]]'') exploring the history of the ''Dune'' universe before the events within ''Dune'', as well as two post-''Chapterhouse Dune'' novels that complete the original series (''[[Hunters of Dune]]'' and ''[[Sandworms of Dune]]'') based on Frank Herbert's own ''Dune 7'' outline.{{Herbert notes}}
