'''John Corcoran''' (born 1937) is a [[logic]]ian, [[philosopher]], [[mathematician]], and [[History of logic|historian of logic]]. He is best known for his philosophical work on concepts such as the nature of [[inference]], relations between [[Condition (philosophy)|conditions]], [[argument-deduction-proof distinctions]], the relationship between [[logic]] and [[epistemology]], and the place of [[proof theory]] and [[model theory]] in logic. Nine of Corcoran’s papers have been translated into Spanish, Portuguese, [[Persian language|Persian]], and [[Arabic]]; his 1989 "signature" essay<ref>Argumentations and Logic. Argumentation ‘’’3’’’(1989) 17–43., 1994 Spanish translation by R. Fernandez and J. Sagüillo;2010 Portuguese translation by W. Sanz; 2011 Persian translation by H.

==Education==
Corcoran studied engineering at the [[Baltimore Polytechnic Institute]],
Advanced Curriculum Engineering 1956, and the [[Johns Hopkins University]], BES Mechanical Engineering 1959. After briefly working in engineering, he studied philosophy at the [[Johns Hopkins University]]:  MA
Philosophy 1962, PhD. Philosophy 1963. Post-doctoral study: [[Yeshiva University]], Mathematics
1964 and [[University of California Berkeley]], Mathematics 1965. Dissertation: Generative
Structure of Two-valued Logics; Supervisor Robert McNaughton (PhD student of [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]).

Corcoran’s student years, the late 1950s and early 1960s, were wonderful times to be learning logic, its history, and its philosophy.  His first logic teacher was Albert Hammond, who passed on from his own dissertation supervisor [[Arthur Lovejoy]] the tradition of the history of ideas—a tradition that his university, The Johns Hopkins University, had become famous for.  Corcoran studied Plato and Aristotle with [[Ludwig Edelstein]], the historian of Greek science and medicine who held appointments both at The Johns Hopkins University and at its School of Medicine.  His next two logic teachers were both accomplished and knowledgeable symbolic logicians: Joseph Ullian, a Quine PhD, and Richard Wiebe, a Mates PhD who had studied with Carnap and Tarski. 
Corcoran’s dissertation supervisor, his doctor father, was Robert McNaughton, a Quine PhD who had already made a name for himself in three fields: the metamathematics of number theory, the theory of formal languages, and the theory of automata.  McNaughton encouraged Corcoran to do post-doctoral studies at Yeshiva University in New York City with [[Raymond Smullyan]] and [[Martin Davis]], both doctoral students of [[Alonzo Church]].  McNaughton later encouraged Corcoran to go to [[UC Berkeley]], the world center for logic and methodology, and he recommended Corcoran to his Berkeley colleagues.  He was also instrumental in Corcoran’s move to his first tenure-track position, at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where McNaughton was a Professor of Computer and Information Science.  In those early years Corcoran also attended semester-long courses and seminars by several other logicians, including John Addison, a [[Stephen Kleene]] PhD, [[Leon Henkin]], another Church PhD, and [[John Myhill]], another Quine PhD.  Corcoran often mentions his teachers with great respect and warmth.

==Regular academic or research appointments==
He has been Professor of Philosophy, [[University at Buffalo]] (SUNY), 1973–; Associate Professor of Philosophy, University at Buffalo, 1970–1973;
Assistant Professor of Linguistics, [[University of Pennsylvania]], 1965–1969; Member of
Linguistics Group, IBM Research Center, 1963–1964.

==Visiting academic or research appointments==
He is or was Visiting Professor of Logic, University of
Santiago de Compostela 1994; Visiting Scholar, Linguistic Institute, SUNY Oswego 1976; NSF
Seminar Project Director, Linguistic Institute, University at Buffalo 1971; Visiting Associate
Professor of Philosophy and Research Associate, [[University of Michigan]] 1969–1970; Visiting
Lecturer in Philosophy, [[University of California, Berkeley]] 1964–1965; Mathematician, [[General Electric Research Laboratory]] 1962; Mathematician, Aeronca Astromechanics Institute, 1961; Junior
Instructor in Philosophy, [[Johns Hopkins University]] 1960–1961.

==Research profile==

Corcoran’s work in [[history of logic]] involves most of the discipline’s
productive periods. He has discussed [[Aristotle]], the [[Stoicism|Stoics]], [[William of Ockham]], [[Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri]], [[George Boole]], [[Richard Dedekind]], [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[Clarence Irving Lewis]], the American Postulate Theorists, [[Alfred Tarski]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], and [[Warren Goldfarb]].

His 1972 interpretation of Aristotle’s [[Prior Analytics]],<ref>Degnan, M. 1994. Recent Work in Aristotle's Logic. Philosophical Books 35.2 (April, 1994): 81-89.</ref> proposed independently by [[Timothy Smiley]] at about the same time, has been found to be more faithful than previous interpretations both to the Greek text and to the historical context. It has formed the basis for subsequent investigations by Edgar Andrade, George Boger, Manuel Correia, Paolo Crivelli, [[Newton da Costa]], Catarina Dutilh, Paolo Fait, Nicolas Fillion, James Gasser, Klaus Glashoff, John Martin, Mary Mulhern, Michael Scanlan, Robin Smith, Neil Tennant, and others. It was adopted for the 1989 translation of the Prior Analytics by Robin Smith and for the 2009 translation of the Prior Analytics Book A by [[Gisela Striker]].

His 1980 critical reconstruction of Boole’s original 1847 system revealed previously unnoticed gaps and errors in Boole’s work and established the essentially Aristotelian basis of Boole’s philosophy of logic. A 2003 article<ref>Corcoran, John (2003). “Aristotle's Prior Analytics and Boole's Laws of Thought”. ''History and Philosophy of Logic'', '''24''': 261–288. Reviewed by Risto Vilkko. ''Bulletin of Symbolic Logic'', '''11'''(2005) 89–91. Also by Marcel Guillaume, ''Mathematical Reviews'' 2033867 (2004m:03006).</ref> provides a systematic comparison and critical evaluation of [[Aristotelian logic]] and [[Boolean logic]]; it also reveals the centrality of [[wholistic reference]] in Boole's [[philosophy of logic]]. According to Corcoran, Boole fully accepted and endorsed Aristotle’s logic. Boole did not dispute one point that Aristotle made, but he did  “go under, over, and beyond” Aristotle’s logic by 1) providing it with mathematical foundations involving equations,2) extending the class of problems it could treat—to assessing validity he added solving equations--,and 3) expanding the range of applications it could handle—e.g. from propositions having only two terms to those having arbitrarily many.

More specifically, Boole agreed with what [[Aristotle]] said; Boole’s ‘disagreements’, if they might be called that, concern what Aristotle did not say. 
First, in the realm of foundations, Boole reduced Aristotle’s four propositional forms of to one form, that of equations—-by itself a revolutionary idea. 
Second, in the realm of logic’s problems, Boole’s addition of equation solving to logic—-another revolutionary idea—-involved Boole’s doctrine that Aristotle’s rules of inference (the “perfect syllogisms”) must be supplemented by rules for equation solving. 
Third, in the realm of applications, Boole’s system could handle multi-term propositions and arguments whereas Aristotle could handle only two-termed subject-predicate propositions and arguments. For example, Aristotle’s system could not deduce “No quadrangle that is a square is a rectangle that is a rhombus” from “No square that is a quadrangle is a rhombus that is a rectangle” or from “No rhombus that is a rectangle is a square that is a quadrangle”.

==Scientific work==

His work in [[philosophy of logic]] focuses on the nature of logic, the role of logic in
inquiry, the conceptual structure of logic, the [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] and [[epistemological]] presuppositions
of logic, the nature of [[mathematical logic]] and the gaps between logical theory and mathematical
practice. His [[mathematical logic]] treats [[propositional logic]]s, [[modal logic]]s, identity logics,
[[syllogistic]] logics, the logic of first-order variable-binding term operators, [[second-order logic]]s,
[[model theory]], and [[Concatenation theory|the theory of strings]] – a discipline which is foundational in all areas of logic
and which provides essential background for all of his other mathematical work. In [[philosophy of mathematics]] Corcoran has been guided by a nuanced and inclusionary [[Platonism]] which
strives to do justice to all aspects of mathematical and logical experience including those aspects
emphasized by competing philosophical perspectives such as [[logicism]], [[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructivism]],
[[deductivism]], and [[formalism (mathematics)|formalism]]. Although several of his philosophical papers presuppose little
history or mathematics, his historical papers often involve either original philosophy (e.g. his
recent BSL article “Schemata”) or original mathematics (e.g. his 1980 HPL article
“Categoricity”). He has referred to the mathematical dimension of his approach to history as
mathematical archaeology. His philosophical papers often involve original historical research. He has been
guided by the Aristotelian principle that the nature of modern thought is sometimes best
understood in light of its historical development, a view that he attributes to [[Arthur Lovejoy]]’s
History of Ideas Program at Johns Hopkins University and in which he has been encouraged by
the American philosopher and historian Peter Hare.<ref>Corcoran, John, (2009). Remembering My Life with Peter Hare. Remembering Peter Hare 1935–2008. Ed. J. Campbell. Society for the Advancement of American Philosophy. pp. 9–16.

==Collaboration==


Many of Corcoran’s articles and reviews are co-authored and many of his single-author
publications acknowledge involvement of colleagues and students. Corcoran emphasizes the
intensely and essentially personal nature of all genuine knowledge including logical knowledge.
Nevertheless, he also stresses the importance of communities of knowers and how much each person can
benefit in the personal search for truth from critical cooperation with other objective researchers. For over 40 years he was the leader of the “Buffalo Syllogistic Group”—a community of philosophers, historians, linguists, logicians, and mathematicians dedicated to the study of the origin of logic. The achievements of this community are sketched in his 2009 paper [http://www.revistas.unal.edu.co/index.php/idval/article/viewFile/12581/13183 “Aristotle’s Logic at the University at Buffalo’s Department of Philosophy”, Ideas y Valores]: Revista Colombiana de Filosofía 140 (August 2009) 99–117.
A list of his publications, complete through 2000, appears in the 1999 volume of [http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/tf/01445340.html History and Philosophy of Logic], which also includes the expository article by M. Scanlan and S. [[Stewart Shapiro|Shapiro]]
“The Work of John Corcoran: An Appreciation”. Other articles about his work include
“Corcoran the Mathematician” by S. [[Stewart Shapiro|Shapiro]], “Corcoran the Philosopher” by J. M. Sagüillo, and
“Corcoran in Spanish” by C. Martínez-Vidal; all appear in a 2007 volume published by the
[[University of Santiago de Compostela]] Press.<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=9IMEm4dYQXUC .</ref>
Corcoran’s work in the 1990s on information-theoretic logic is discussed by [[José Miguel Sagüillo|José M. Sagüillo]] in the article “Methodological Practice and Complementary Concepts of Logical Consequence: Tarski's Model-Theoretic Consequence and Corcoran's Information-Theoretic Consequence” (History and Philosophy of Logic
volume 30, 2009, 21-48), which received the 2009 Ivor Grattan-Guinness Award for the History and Philosophy of Logic ( http://informaworld.com/thpl ).

==Teaching==
Corcoran’s courses are all introductory, having no prerequisites and presupposing no
previous knowledge.<ref>http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1091372</ref> In each course he reconstructs its subject-matter from the ground up and never covers the same material twice. Stressing the priority of education over indoctrination and the superiority of learning how to think over learning what to think, he strives to assist his
students in connecting with the reality logic is about so that they may become autonomous judges of the adequacy of the field.<ref>Corcoran, John, 2012. ‘’Farewell letter to my students”. ‘‘Philosophy Now’’.  
Issue ‘’’97’’’ September/October 2012.http://www.pdcnet.org/philnow/content/philnow_2012_0092_0018_0018</ref>

His former students teach at the Autonomous University of Mexico City, Bryn Mawr, Canisius College,Colorado State, Dordt College, Franciscan University, Fredonia State, Ohio State, Oregon State, Pontifical University of Rio de Janeiro, St. John Fisher College, St. John’s College, UCLA, [[University of Lausanne]], [[University of Santiago de Compostela]], and elsewhere.

His best-known students include George Boger, James Gasser, Calvin Jongsma, Idris Samawi Hamid, [[Edward Keenan]],Timothy Madigan, Sriram Nambiar, [[José Miguel Sagüillo]], Michael Scanlan, [[Stewart Shapiro]], and George Weaver.
