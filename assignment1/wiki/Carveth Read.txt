==Work==
In the preface to the fourth edition of his book ''Logic: Deductive and Inductive'' (1920), he identifies his significant influences.  He states, "the work may be considered, on the whole, as attached to the school of Mill; to whose System of Logic, and to Bain's Logic, it is deeply indebted. Amongst the works of living writers, the Empirical Logic of Venn and the Formal Logic of Keynes have given me most assistance."<ref>C. Read, "Logic: Deductive and Inductive," London: Simkin, Marshall (1920), p. vi.</ref>  In Chapter 22 of Logic, Read says: "It is better to be vaguely right than exactly wrong", the original source of the much quoted aphorism "It is better to be roughly right than exactly wrong" that is often, incorrently attributed to John Maynard Keynes.
