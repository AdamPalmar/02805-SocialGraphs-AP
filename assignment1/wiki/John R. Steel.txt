'''John Robert Steel''' (born October 30, 1948) is an American set theorist at [[University of California, Berkeley]] (formerly at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]).  He has made many contributions to the theory of [[inner model]]s and [[determinacy]].  With [[Donald A. Martin]], he proved [[projective determinacy]], assuming the existence of sufficient [[large cardinal]]s.  He earned his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in Logic & the Methodology of Science at Berkeley in 1977 under the joint supervision of John West Addison, Jr. and [[Steve Simpson (mathematician)|Stephen G. Simpson]].<ref>{{MathGenealogy|id=22128}}</ref>

In 2015 the European Set Theory Society awarded him and [[Ronald Jensen]] the ''Hausdorff medal'' for their paper "K without the measurable".
