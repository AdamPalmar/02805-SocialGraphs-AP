==Life and career==
[[File:Martha Nussbaum 2010.jpg|thumb|Nussbaum in 2010]]

Nussbaum was born in [[New York City]], the daughter of George Craven, a Philadelphia lawyer, and Betty Warren, an interior designer and homemaker; during her teenage years, Nussbaum attended the [[Baldwin School]] in [[Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania|Bryn Mawr]]. She described her upbringing as "East Coast [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] elite...very sterile, very preoccupied with money and status".<ref>McLemee, Scott. ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]''. [http://chronicle.com/free/v48/i06/06a01401.htm "What Makes Martha Nussbaum Run?"]</ref>  She would later credit her impatience with "mandarin philosophers" as the "repudiation of my own aristocratic upbringing. I don't like anything that sets itself up as an in-group or an elite, whether it is the [[Bloomsbury Group|Bloomsbury group]] or [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]]".<ref name="robertboynton1">Boynton, Robert S. ''The New York Times Magazine.'' [http://www.robertboynton.com/articleDisplay.php?article_id=55 Who Needs Philosophy? A Profile of Martha Nussbaum]</ref>

She studied [[theatre]] and [[classics]] at [[New York University]], getting a BA in 1969, and gradually moved to philosophy while at [[Harvard University]], where she received an MA in 1972 and a PhD in 1975, studying under [[G.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;L. Owen]]. This period also saw her marriage to [[Alan Nussbaum]] (married in 1969, divorced in 1987), her [[conversion to Judaism]], and the birth of her daughter Rachel.

Nussbaum's interest in Judaism has continued and deepened: on August 16, 2008 she became a ''[[bat mitzvah]]'' in a service at [[K.A.M. Isaiah Israel Temple|Temple K. A. M. Isaiah Israel]] in Chicago's [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]], chanting from the ''[[Parashah]] Va-etchanan'' and the ''[[Haftarah]] Nahamu'', and delivering a ''D'var [[Torah]]'' about the connection between genuine, non-[[narcissistic]] consolation and the pursuit of [[global justice]].<ref>"The Mourner's Hope: Grief and the Foundations of Justice", ''The Boston Review'', November/December 2008., 18-20.</ref>

During her studies at Harvard, Nussbaum claims she encountered a tremendous amount of discrimination, including sexual harassment, and problems getting childcare for her daughter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people6/Nussbaum/nussbaum-con1.html|title=Conversation with Martha C. Nussbaum, p. 1 of 6|work=berkeley.edu}}</ref> When she became the first woman to hold the [[Harvard Fellow|Junior Fellowship at Harvard]], Nussbaum received a congratulatory note from a "prestigious classicist" who suggested that since "female fellowess" was an awkward name, she should be called ''[[Hetaera|hetaira]]'', for in Greece these educated courtesans were the only women who participated in philosophical symposia.<ref>Nussbaum, Martha C. ''Cultivating Humanity: A Classical Defense of Reform in Liberal Education.'' Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press, 1997. pp. 6-7.</ref>

In the 1970s and early 1980 she taught philosophy and classics at Harvard, where she was denied tenure by the Classics Department in 1982.<ref name="robertboynton1"/> Nussbaum then moved to [[Brown University]], where she taught until 1994 when she joined the [[University of Chicago Law School]] faculty. Her 1986 book ''The Fragility of Goodness'', on ancient Greek ethics and Greek tragedy, made her a well-known figure throughout the humanities.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} More recent work (''Frontiers of Justice'') establishes Nussbaum as a theorist of global justice.

Nussbaum's work on capabilities has often focused on the unequal freedoms and opportunities of women, and she has developed a distinctive type of feminism, drawing inspiration from the liberal tradition, but emphasizing that liberalism, at its best, entails radical rethinking of gender relations and relations within the family.<ref>Nussbaum, Martha. ''Women and Human Development''. New York:  Cambridge University Press, 2000.</ref>

Nussbaum's other major area of philosophical work is the emotions.  She has defended a ''neo-[[stoicism|Stoic]]'' account of emotions that holds that they are appraisals that ascribe to things and persons, outside the agent's own control, great significance for the person's own flourishing.  On this basis she has proposed analyses of grief, compassion, and love,<ref>Nussbaum, Martha C. Poetic Justice:  ''Literary Imagination and Public Life.'' Boston:  Beacon Press, 1995.</ref> and, in a later book, of disgust and shame.<ref>Nussbaum, Martha C. ''Hiding from Humanity:  Shame, Disgust, and the Law.''  Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2004.</ref>

Nussbaum has engaged in many spirited debates with other intellectuals, in her academic writings as well as in the pages of semi-popular magazines and book reviews and, in one instance, when testifying as an expert witness in court. She testified in the Colorado bench trial for ''[[Romer v. Evans]]'', arguing against the claim that the history of philosophy provides the state with a "compelling interest" in favor of a law denying gays and lesbians the right to seek passage of local non-discrimination laws. A portion of this testimony, dealing with the potential meanings of the term ''tolmêma'' in Plato's work, was the subject of controversy, and was called misleading and even [[perjury|perjurious]] by critics.<ref>[http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9609/stand.html The Stand] by Daniel Mendelsohn, from ''[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]'' September 1996.</ref><ref>[http://www.robertboynton.com/articleDisplay.php?article_id=55 Who Needs Philosophy?: A profile of Martha Nussbaum] by Robert Boynton from ''The New York Times Magazine'', November 21, 1999</ref> She responded to these charges in a lengthy article called "Platonic Love and Colorado Law".<ref>Martha C.

The debate continued with a reply by one of her sternest critics, [[Robert P. George]].<ref>George, Robert P. '"Shameless Acts" Revisited: Some Questions for Martha Nussbaum', Academic Questions 9 (Winter 1995-96), 24-42.</ref>  Nussbaum has criticized [[Noam Chomsky]] as being among the leftist intellectuals who hold the belief that "one should not criticize one’s friends, that solidarity is more important than ethical correctness". She suggests that one can "trace this line to an old Marxist contempt for bourgeois ethics, but it is loathsome whatever its provenance".<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/violence-on-the-left-nandigram-and-the-communists-of-west-bengal |title=Violence on the Left |author=Martha C.

Nussbaum is a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (elected 1988) and the [[American Philosophical Society]]. In 2008 she was elected a Corresponding Fellow of the [[British Academy]].  She is a Founding President and Past President of the [[Human Development and Capability Association]] and a Past President of the [[American Philosophical Association]], Central Division. She won the [[Kyoto Prize]] in 2015, and in 2017 the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] selected Nussbaum to deliver the [[Jefferson Lecture]], the U.S. federal government's highest honor for achievement in the [[humanities]]; her lecture, to be delivered in May 2017, will be entitled "Powerlessness and the Politics of Blame."<ref name="IHEJeffLecture">[https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2017/01/19/martha-nussbaum-named-jefferson-lecturer "Martha Nussbaum Named Jefferson Lecturer"], ''[[Inside Higher Ed]]'', January 19, 2017.</ref>

==Major works==

===''The Fragility of Goodness: Luck and Ethics in Greek Tragedy and Philosophy''===
''The Fragility of Goodness''<ref>Nussbaum, Martha C. ''The Fragility of Goodness: Luck and Ethics in Greek Tragedy and Philosophy.'' New York: Cambridge University Press, 1986.</ref> confronts the [[ethical dilemma]] that individuals strongly committed to [[justice]] are nevertheless vulnerable to external factors that may deeply compromise or even negate their [[human flourishing]]. Discussing literary as well as philosophical texts, Nussbaum seeks to determine the extent to which [[reason]] may enable self-sufficiency. She eventually rejects the [[Platonism|Platonic]] notion that human goodness can fully protect against peril, siding with the [[Tragedy|tragic]] [[playwright]]s and [[Aristotle]] in treating the acknowledgment of vulnerability as a key to realizing the human good.

Her interpretation of [[Plato]]'s ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' in particular drew considerable attention. Under Nussbaum's consciousness of vulnerability, the re-entrance of [[Alcibiades]] at the end of the dialogue undermines [[Diotima of Mantinea|Diotima]]'s account of the ladder of love in its ascent to the non-physical realm of the [[Theory of the forms|forms]]. Alcibiades's presence deflects attention back to physical [[beauty]], sexual passions, and bodily limitations, hence highlighting human fragility.

''Fragility'' made Nussbaum famous throughout the humanities. It garnered wide praise in academic reviews,<ref>Barnes, Hazel E. ''Comparative Literature'', Vol. 40, No. 1 (Winter, 1988), pp. 76-77</ref><ref>Woodruff, Paul B. ''Philosophy and Phenomenological Research'', Vol. 50, No. 1 (Sep. 1989), pp. 205-210</ref> and even drew acclaim in the popular media.<ref>[[Bernard Knox|Knox, Bernard]]. "The Theater of Ethics". [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/article-preview?article_id=4941 ''The New York Review of Books'']</ref> [[Camille Paglia]] credited ''Fragility'' with matching "the highest academic standards" of the twentieth century,<ref>Paglia, Camille. ''Sex, Art, & American Culture''. NY: Vintage Books, 1991. pp. 206</ref> and ''The Times Higher Education'' called it "a supremely scholarly work".<ref>Hodges, Lucy. [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=95200&sectioncode=26 ''And you may ask yourself...]''</ref> Nussbaum's fame extended her influence beyond print and into television programs like PBS's [[Bill Moyers]].<ref>[https://archive.is/20120909144927/http://www.shoppbs.org/sm-pbs-applying-the-lessons-of-ancient-greece-martha-nussbaum-dvd--pi-2407861.html/ ''NOW with Bill Moyers'']</ref>

===''Cultivating Humanity''===
''Cultivating Humanity''<ref>Nussbaum, Martha C. ''Cultivating Humanity: A Classical Defense of Reform in Liberal Education.'' Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press, 1997.</ref> appeals to classical Greek texts as a basis for defense and reform of the [[liberal education]]. Noting the Greek [[Cynicism (philosophy)|cynic]] philosopher [[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogenes]]' aspiration to transcend "local origins and group memberships" in favor of becoming "a [[Global citizenship#World citizen|citizen of the world]]", Nussbaum traces the development of this idea through the [[Stoicism|Stoics]], [[Cicero]], and eventually modern [[liberalism]] of [[Adam Smith]] and [[Immanuel Kant]]. Nussbaum champions [[multiculturalism]] in the context of [[ethical universalism]], defends scholarly inquiry into race, gender, and [[human sexuality]], and further develops the role of literature as narrative imagination into ethical questions.

At the same time, Nussbaum also censured certain scholarly trends. She excoriated [[deconstructionist]] [[Jacques Derrida]] as "on [[truth]] [] simply not worth studying for someone who has been studying [W. V. O.] [[W. V. O. Quine|Quine]] and [Hilary] [[Hilary Putnam|Putnam]] and [Donald] [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Davidson]]" and also cites Zhang Longxi, who labels Derrida's analysis of [[Chinese culture]] "pernicious" and without "evidence of serious study".<ref>Nussbaum, Martha C. ''Cultivating Humanity: A Classical Defense of Reform in Liberal Education.'' Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press, 1997. pages 41 & 126.</ref>  More broadly, Nussbaum criticized [[Michel Foucault]] for his "historical incompleteness [and] lack of conceptual clarity", but nevertheless singled him out for providing "the only truly important work to have entered philosophy under the banner of '[[Postmodern philosophy|postmodernism]].'"<ref>Nussbaum, Martha C. ''Cultivating Humanity: A Classical Defense of Reform in Liberal Education.'' Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press, 1997. p.40</ref>  Nussbaum is even more critical of figures like [[Allan Bloom]], [[Roger Kimball]], and [[George Will]] for what she considers their "shaky" knowledge of non-Western cultures and inaccurate caricatures of today's humanities departments.

''The [[New York Times]]'' praised ''Cultivating Humanity'' as "a passionate, closely argued defense of multiculturalism" and hailed it as "a formidable, perhaps definitive defense of diversity on American campuses".<ref>Shapiro, James. ''Beyond the Culture Wars''. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00E4D61E3EF937A35752C0A96E958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2/ ''The New York Times'']</ref> Nussbaum was the 2002 recipient of the University of Louisville [[Grawemeyer Award|Grawmeyer Award]] in Education.

===''Sex and Social Justice''===
''Sex and Social Justice'' sets out to demonstrate that sex and sexuality are morally irrelevant distinctions that have been artificially enforced as sources of [[social hierarchy]]; thus, [[feminism]] and [[social justice]] have common concerns. Rebutting anti-universalist objections, Nussbaum proposes functional freedoms, or central human capabilities, as a rubric of social justice.<ref>Nussbaum, Martha C. ''Sex & Social Justice.'' New York: Oxford University Press, 1999.  pp. 29-47.</ref>

Nussbaum discusses at length the feminist critiques of [[liberalism]] itself, including the charge advanced by [[Alison Jaggar]] that liberalism demands [[ethical egoism]].  Nussbaum notes that liberalism emphasizes respect for ''others'' as individuals, and further argues that Jaggar has elided the distinction between [[individualism]] and self-sufficiency.  Nussbaum accepts [[Catharine MacKinnon]]'s critique of abstract liberalism, assimilating the salience of history and context of group hierarchy and subordination, but concludes that this appeal is rooted in liberalism rather than a critique of it.<ref>Nussbaum, Martha C. ''Sex & Social Justice.'' New York: Oxford University Press, 1999.  pp. 55-80.</ref>

Nussbaum condemns the practice of [[female genital mutilation]], citing deprivation of [[normative]] human functioning in its risks to health, impact on sexual functioning, violations of dignity, and conditions of non-[[autonomy]]. Emphasizing that female genital mutilation is carried out by brute force, its irreversibility, its non-consensual nature, and its links to customs of [[Patriarchy|male domination]], Nussbaum urges feminists to confront female genital mutilation as an issue of injustice.<ref>Nussbaum, Martha C. ''Sex & Social Justice.'' New York: Oxford University Press, 1999.  pp. 118-130.</ref>

Nussbaum also refines the concept of "[[objectification]]", as originally advanced by [[Catharine MacKinnon]] and [[Andrea Dworkin]]. Nussbaum defines the idea of treating as an object with seven qualities: [[instrumental rationality|instrumentality]], denial of autonomy, inertness, [[fungibility]], violability, ownership, and denial of [[subjectivity]]. Her characterization of [[pornography]] as a tool of objectification puts Nussbaum at odds with [[sex-positive feminism]]. At the same time, Nussbaum argues in support of the legalization of [[prostitution]], a position she reiterated in a 2008 essay following the [[Eliot Spitzer prostitution scandal|Spitzer scandal]], writing: "The idea that we ought to penalize women with few choices by removing one of the ones they do have is grotesque."<ref>Martha Nussbaum, "[http://www.ajc.com/search/content/opinion/2008/03/13/spitzered_0314.html Trading on America's [[puritan]]ical streak]", ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'', March 14, 2008</ref>

''Sex and Social Justice'' was lauded by critics in the press. [[Salon (magazine)|Salon]] declared: "She shows brilliantly how sex is used to deny some people—i.e., women and gay men—social justice."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/books/it/1999/04/19/nussbaum/|title=Rescuing the Feminist Book|author=Maria Russo|work=salon.com}}</ref>  The ''[[New York Times]]'' praised the work as "elegantly written and carefully argued".<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/03/14/reviews/990314.14ryanlt.html?scp=5&sq=martha%20nussbaum&st=cse "Cultural Perversions"]</ref> Kathryn Trevenen praised Nussbaum's effort to shift feminist concerns toward interconnected transnational efforts, and for explicating a set of universal guidelines to structure an agenda of social justice.<ref>Trevenen, Kathryn.  "Global Feminism and the 'Problem' of Culture". ''Theory & Event'' 5.1 (2001).</ref>  Patrick Hopkins singled out for praise Nussbaum's "masterful" chapter on sexual objectification.<ref>Hopkins, Patrick D. "Sex and Social Justice". ''Hypatia'' 17.2 (2002): 171-173.</ref> Radical feminist Andrea Dworkin faulted Nussbaum for "consistent over-intellectualisation of emotion, which has the inevitable consequence of mistaking suffering for cruelty".<ref>Dworkin, Andrea R. "Rape is not just another word for suffering". ''Times Higher Education.'' August 4, 2000.</ref>

===''Hiding from Humanity''===
''Hiding from Humanity''<ref>Nussbaum, Martha C. ''Hiding from Humanity: Disgust, Shame, and the Law.'' Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2004.</ref> extends Nussbaum's work in [[moral psychology]] to probe the arguments for including two emotions—[[shame]] and [[disgust]]—as legitimate bases for legal judgments. Nussbaum argues that individuals tend to repudiate their bodily imperfection or [[animal]]ity through the projection of fears about contamination. This cognitive response is in itself irrational, because we cannot transcend the animality of our bodies. Noting how [[psychological projection|projective]] disgust has wrongly justified group subordination (mainly of women, [[Jews]], and [[homosexuals]]), Nussbaum ultimately discards disgust as a reliable basis of judgment.

Turning to shame, Nussbaum argues that shame takes too broad a target, attempting to inculcate [[humiliation]] on a scope that is too intrusive and limiting on human freedom. Nussbaum sides with [[John Stuart Mill]] in narrowing legal concern to acts that cause a distinct and assignable harm.

In an interview with ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' magazine, Nussbaum elaborated: "Disgust and shame are inherently [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]]; they set up ranks and orders of human beings. They are also inherently connected with restrictions on [[liberty]] in areas of non-harmful conduct. For both of these reasons, I believe, anyone who cherishes the key [[Democracy|democratic]] values of [[egalitarianism|equality]] and liberty should be deeply suspicious of the appeal to those emotions in the context of law and [[public policy]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/33316.html|title=Discussing Disgust|work=Reason.com}}</ref>

Nussbaum's work was received with wide praise. ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' called her argument "characteristically lucid" and hailed her as "America's most prominent philosopher of [[public life]]".<ref>Wilson, John. ''You Stink therefore I am''.[http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2004/05/02/you_stink_therefore_i_am/?page=2/ ''The Boston Globe'']</ref> Her reviews in national newspapers and magazines garnered unanimous praise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/08/08/LVGC580JDU1.DTL&hw=nussbaum&sn=002&sc=952/|title=Philosopher warns us against using shame as punishment / Guilt can be creative, but the blame game is dangerous|work=SFGate}}</ref> In academic circles, Stefanie A. Lindquist of [[Vanderbilt University]] lauded Nussbaum's analysis as a "remarkably wide ranging and nuanced treatise on the interplay between emotions and law".<ref>[http://www.bsos.umd.edu/gvpt/lpbr/subpages/reviews/nussbaum904.htm ''Stefanie A. Lindquist's Review'']</ref>

A prominent exception was [[Roger Kimball]]'s review published in ''[[The New Criterion]]'',<ref>Kimball, Roger. ''The New Criterion''.[http://www.newcriterion.com/archive/23/sept04/shame.htm ''Does Shame have a Future?'']</ref> in which he accused Nussbaum of "fabricating" the renewed prevalence of shame and disgust in public discussions and says she intends to "undermine the inherited moral wisdom of millennia". He rebukes her for "contempt for the opinions of ordinary people"  and ultimately accuses Nussbaum herself of "hiding from humanity".

Nussbaum has recently drawn on and extended her work on disgust to produce a new analysis of the legal issues regarding sexual orientation and same-sex conduct.  Her book ''From Disgust to Humanity: Sexual Orientation and the Constitution'' was published by Oxford University Press in 2009, as part of their "Inalienable Rights" series, edited by Geoffrey Stone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Law/ConstitutionalLaw/?view=usa&ci=9780195305319|title=From Disgust to Humanity|work=oup.com}}</ref>

===''From Disgust to Humanity: Sexual Orientation and Constitutional Law''===

In the 2010 book ''[[From Disgust to Humanity|From Disgust to Humanity: Sexual Orientation and Constitutional Law]]'' Martha Nussbaum analyzes the role that disgust plays in law and public debate in the United States.<ref>Nussbaum, Martha. Oxford University Press. "From Disgust to Humanity: Sexual Orientation and Constitutional Law" (2010)</ref> The book primarily analyzes constitutional legal issues facing gay and lesbian Americans but also analyzes issues such as anti-miscegenation statutes, segregation, antisemitism and the caste system in India as part of its broader thesis regarding the "politics of disgust".

Nussbaum posits that the fundamental motivations of those advocating legal restrictions against gay and lesbian Americans is a "politics of disgust". These legal restrictions include blocking [[sexual orientation]] being protected under [[anti-discrimination law]]s (See: ''[[Romer v. Evans]]''), sodomy laws against consenting adults (See: ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]''), constitutional bans against same-sex marriage (See: [[California Proposition 8 (2008)]]), over-strict regulation of gay bathhouses, and bans on sex in public parks and public restrooms.<ref>For the last two, see Martha Nussbaum, ''From Disgust to Humanity: Sexual Orientation and Constitutional Law''.  Oxford University Press, 2010, 198-199.</ref>  Nussbaum also argues that legal bans on polygamy and certain forms of incestuous (e.g. brother-sister) marriage partake of the politics of disgust and should be overturned.<ref>Nussbaum, ''From Disgust to Humanity'', 154-155.</ref>

She identifies the "politics of disgust" closely with [[Lord Devlin]] and his famous opposition to the [[Wolfenden report]] that recommended decriminalizing private consensual homosexual acts on the basis that those things would "disgust the average man". To Devlin, the mere fact some people or act may produce popular emotional reactions of disgust provides an appropriate guide for legislating. She also identifies the '[[wisdom of repugnance]]' as advocated by [[Leon Kass]] as another "politics of disgust" school of thought as it claims that disgust "in crucial cases ... repugnance is the emotional expression of deep wisdom, beyond reason's power fully to articulate it".

Nussbaum goes on to explicitly oppose the concept of a disgust-based morality as an appropriate guide for legislating. Nussbaum notes that popular disgust has been used throughout history as a justification for persecution. Drawing upon her earlier work on the relationship between disgust and shame, Nussbaum notes that at various times, [[racism]], [[antisemitism]], and [[sexism]], have all been driven by popular revulsion.<ref name="Nussbaum 2004">{{Cite web |author=Nussbaum, Martha C. |url=http://chronicle.com/free/v50/i48/48b00601.htm |title=Danger to Human Dignity: The Revival of Disgust and Shame in the Law |work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |date=August 6, 2004 |accessdate=2007-11-24 |location=Washington, DC}}</ref>

In place of this "politics of disgust", Nussbaum argues for the [[harm principle]] from [[John Stuart Mill]] as the proper basis for limiting individual liberties. Nussbaum argues the harm principle, which supports the legal ideas of [[consent]], the [[age of majority]], and [[privacy]], protects citizens while the "politics of disgust" is merely an unreliable emotional reaction with no inherent wisdom. Furthermore, Nussbaum argues this "politics of disgust" has denied and continues to deny citizens humanity and [[equality before the law]] on no rational grounds and causes palpable social harms to the groups affected.
