'''John Hawthorne''' is Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Southern California]].<ref>https://dornsife.usc.edu/cf/phil/faculty_display.cfm?Person_ID=1047479</ref>  He is recognized as a leading contemporary contributor to metaphysics and epistemology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780198250241.do |title=The Oxford Handbook of Metaphysics: Hardback: Michael J. Loux|publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2003-08-28 |accessdate=2013-08-26}}</ref>

His 2006 collection ''Metaphysical Essays'' offers original treatments of fundamental topics in philosophy, including identity, ontology, vagueness, and causation, which one reviewer called "essential reading for anyone currently engaged in analytic metaphysics".<ref>https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/25198-metaphysical-essays/</ref>
In his book ''Knowledge and Lotteries'', Hawthorne defends a view in [[epistemology]] according to which the presence of knowledge is dependent on the subject's interests (he calls this view 'Subject-Sensitive Invariantism').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/23836-knowledge-and-lotteries/|title=Knowledge and Lotteries|first=Matthew|last=McGrath|work=Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews|date=6 August 2004|accessdate=9 December 2012}}</ref> Unlike [[contextualism]], Hawthorne's view does not require that the meaning of the word "know" changes from one context of ascription to another. His view is thus a variety of invariantism. However, whether a subject has knowledge depends to a surprising extent on features of the ''subject's'' context, including practical concerns. This position can be classed as a form of [[pragmatism]]. The American philosopher [[Jason Stanley]] holds a similar view.

Hawthorne has also written on philosophy of language and philosophical logic, philosophy of religion, philosophy of mind, and on [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]].

==Education==
