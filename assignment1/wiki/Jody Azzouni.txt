'''Jody Azzouni''' (born '''Jawad Azzouni'''; born 1954) is an [[American philosopher]], short fiction writer, and poet. He currently is Professor of Philosophy at [[Tufts University]].

==Education==
He received his [[bachelor's degree]] and [[master's degree]] from [[New York University]] and his PhD from the [[City University of New York]].

==Career and philosophical positions==
Azzouni is currently working on the philosophy of [[mathematics]] (he holds a degree in mathematics), [[science]], [[logic]], [[language]] and in areas of [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], and [[aesthetics]]. He acknowledges, as do many of his peers, a debt to the renowned philosopher, [[Willard Van Orman Quine]].

One of his most distinctive positions is the as yet controversial claim that mathematical objects don't exist.
