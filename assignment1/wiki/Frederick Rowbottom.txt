'''Frederick Rowbottom''' (16 January 1938 – 12 October 2009) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[logician]] and [[mathematician]].  The [[large cardinal]] notion of [[Rowbottom cardinal]]s is named after him.

==Biography==
After graduating from [[Cambridge University]], Rowbottom studied under [[Howard Jerome Keisler]] at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], earning his [[Ph.D.]] degree in 1964, with a thesis entitled ''Large Cardinals and Small Constructible Sets'', under the supervision of [[Jerome Keisler]].<ref>{{MathGenealogy |id=8441}}.</ref>  With a recommendation from [[Georg Kreisel]], he took a position at the [[University of Bristol]] in 1965, where he spent the rest of his professional career.

He published a paper called "Some strong axioms of infinity incompatible with the axiom of constructibility" in the ''Annals of Mathematical Logic'', 3 1971.  This paper, together with his thesis, "showed that Ramsey cardinals were weaker than measurable cardinals, and that their existence implied the constructible real continuum was countable; he further proved that this followed also from weaker partition and two cardinal properties."<ref name=ASL>{{citation|contribution=In Memoriam: Frederick Rowbottom|title=Notices|url=http://www.math.ucla.edu/~asl/bsl/1602/1602-007.ps|journal=Bulletin of Symbolic Logic|volume=16|issue=2|year=2010|page=299|doi=10.2178/bsl/1286889129}}.</ref>  The [[large cardinal]] notion of [[Rowbottom cardinal]]s is named after him,<ref>{{citation | last = Tryba | first = Jan | issue = 3–4 | journal = Israel Journal of Mathematics | pages = 193–196 | title = A few remarks on Rowbottom cardinals | doi = 10.1007/BF02761361 | volume = 40

[[Keith Devlin]] studied [[set theory]] under Rowbottom.  In 1992 he and a student, Jonathan Chapman, wrote a textbook on [[topos theory]], ''Relative Category Theory and Geometric Morphisms: A Logical Approach'', published in ''Oxford Logic Guides'', No. 16.<ref>Rowbottom, Frederick and Jonathan Chapman.

Rowbottom died of heart failure in [[Hadfield, Derbyshire|Hadfield]], England, on 12 October 2009, aged 71.<ref name=ASL/>
