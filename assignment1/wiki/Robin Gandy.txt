'''Robin Oliver Gandy''' (22 September 1919 – 20 November 1995) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[mathematician]] and [[logician]].<ref name="independent">{{cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituaryrobin-gandy-1583406.html | title=Obituary: Robin Gandy | work=[[The Independent]] | date=November 24, 1995 | accessdate=January 1, 2012 | author=Yates, Mike}}</ref>
He was a friend, student, and associate of [[Alan Turing]], having been supervised by Turing during his PhD at the [[University of Cambridge]] (graduated 1953), where they worked together.

Robin Gandy was born in the village of [[Rotherfield Peppard|Peppard]], [[Oxfordshire]], [[England]].<ref name="independent" /> He was the son of Thomas Hall Gandy (1876–1948) and Ida Caroline née Hony (1885–1977) and great-great-grandson of the architect and artist [[Joseph Gandy]] (1771–1843).

Educated at [[Abbotsholme School|Abbotsholme]], Gandy took two years of the [[Mathematical Tripos]], at [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]],  before enlisting for military service in 1940. During [[World War II]] he worked on radio intercept equipment at [[Hanslope Park]], where Alan Turing was working on a speech [[encipherment]] project, and he became one of Turing's lifelong friends and associates. In 1946, he completed Part III of the Mathematical Tripos, then began studying for a PhD under Turing's supervision. He completed his thesis, ''On axiomatic systems in mathematics and theories in Physics'', in 1952. He was a member of the [[Cambridge Apostles|Apostles]].

Gandy held positions at the Universities of [[University of Leicester|Leicester]], [[University of Leeds|Leeds]], and [[School of Mathematics, University of Manchester|Manchester]]. Gandy was a visiting associate professor at [[Stanford University|Stanford]] from 1966 to 1967, and held a similar position at [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in 1968. In 1969, he moved to [[Wolfson College, Oxford]], where he became [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] in Mathematical Logic. One of the residential buildings of the college is now named in his honour.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/stommy/2502650192/ | title=Robin Gandy Buildings, Wolfson | publisher=[[Flickr]] | accessdate=January 1, 2012}}</ref>

He is best known for his work in [[recursion theory]]. His contributions include the [[Spector–Gandy theorem]], the [[Gandy Stage Comparison theorem]], and the [[Gandy Selection Theorem]]. He also made a significant contribution to the [[History of the Church–Turing thesis#Gandy 1980: .22machine computation.22 as discrete.2C deterministic and limited to .22local causation.22 by the speed of light|understanding of the Church—Turing thesis]], and his generalization of the [[Turing machine]] is called a Gandy machine.<ref>[http://www.hss.cmu.edu/philosophy/sieg/Church%20without%20dogma.pdf Wilfried Sieg, 2005, ''Church without dogma: axioms for computability,'' Carnegie Mellon University]</ref>

Gandy died in [[Oxford]], England.<ref name="independent" />
