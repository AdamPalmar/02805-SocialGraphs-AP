Somerville was born in [[Adelaide]], South Australia, and educated at [[Mercedes College (Adelaide)|Mercedes College]] ([[Springfield, South Australia|Springfield]], [[South Australia]]). She received a A.u.A. (pharm.) from the [[University of Adelaide]] in 1963, a [[Bachelor of Law]] degree (Hons. I) and the University Medal from the [[University of Sydney]] in 1973, and a D.C.L. from McGill University in 1978.

In 1978, she was appointed assistant professor in the law faculty at McGill. She was appointed an associate professor in 1979 and an associate professor in the faculty of medicine in 1980. In 1984, she became a full professor in both faculties, and in 1989, she was appointed the Samuel Gale Professor of Law. From 1986 to 1996, she was the founding director of the McGill Centre for Medicine, Ethics and Law and was appointed acting director in 1999. She currently teaches seminars on advanced torts and comparative medical law at McGill.

In November 2006, she gave the five annual [[Massey Lectures]] on [[CBC Radio]] in Canada. An expanded version of the lectures was published in Canada, Australia, and the United States in book form as ''The Ethical Imagination: Journeys of the Human Spirit''.

==Honours==
Among many honours and awards, in 1990, Somerville was made a Member of the [[Order of Australia]] "for service to the law and to bioethics".<ref>[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=882353&search_type=quick&showInd=true]</ref> In 1991, she was made a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Canada]]. In 2004 she was chosen by an international jury as the first recipient of [[UNESCO]]'s Avicenna Prize for Ethics in Science.<ref>[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=20029&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html]</ref>

She has received honorary degrees from [[University of Windsor]] (1992), [[Macquarie University]] (1993), [[St. Francis Xavier University]] (1996) and the [[University of Waterloo]] (2004). Her honorary degree awarded June 19, 2006, at [[Ryerson University]] in [[Toronto]] was controversial<ref>http://www.ccrl.ca/index.php?id=331</ref> because of her objections to [[same sex marriage]].

In 2006, Somerville was nominated for membership in the [[Order of Canada]] by [[Carol Finlay]], a professor at the [[Toronto School of Theology]]. Finlay says Somerville was turned down for the honour because she was "too controversial."<ref>Aubin, Henry. (2006).
