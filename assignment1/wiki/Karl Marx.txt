'''Karl Marx'''<ref name="his_name group=note">The name "Karl Heinrich Marx", used in various lexicons, is based on an error. His birth certificate says "Carl Marx", and elsewhere "Karl Marx" is used. "K. H. Marx" is used only in his poetry collections and the transcript of his dissertation; because Marx wanted to honour his father, who had died in 1838, he called himself "Karl Heinrich" in three documents.[https://archive.org/stream/handwrterbuchder04conr#page/1130/mode/1up The article] by Friedrich Engels "Marx, Karl Heinrich" in ''Handwörterbuch der Staatswissenschaften'' (Jena, 1892, column 1130 to 1133 see ''[[Marx/Engels Collected Works|MECW]]'' Volume 22, pp. 337–345) does not justify assigning Marx a middle name.

''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.</ref> {{IPA-de|ˈkaɐ̯l ˈmaɐ̯ks|lang}}; 5 May 1818 – 14 March 1883) was a [[Prussia]]n-born [[philosopher]], [[economist]], [[Political philosophy|political theorist]], [[sociologist]], [[journalist]] and [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialist]].

Born in [[Trier]] to a middle-class family, Marx later studied [[political economy]] and [[G.W.F. Hegel|Hegelian philosophy]]. As an adult, Marx became [[Statelessness|stateless]] and spent much of his life in [[London, England]], where he continued to develop his thought in collaboration with German thinker [[Friedrich Engels]] and published various works, of which the two most well-known are the 1848 [[pamphlet]] ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' and the three-volume ''[[Das Kapital]]''. His work has since influenced subsequent intellectual, economic and political history.

Marx's theories about society, economics and politics—collectively understood as [[Marxism]]—hold that human societies develop through [[class struggle]]. In [[capitalism]], this manifests itself in the conflict between the ruling classes (known as the [[bourgeoisie]]) that control the [[means of production]] and working classes (known as the [[proletariat]]) that enable these means by selling their [[labour power]] in return for wages.<ref name=manifesto/> Employing a critical approach known as [[historical materialism]], Marx predicted that, like previous socioeconomic systems, capitalism produced internal tensions which would lead to its self-destruction and replacement by a new system: [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialism]]. For Marx, class antagonisms under capitalism, owing in part to its instability and [[crisis theory|crisis-prone nature]], would eventuate the working class' development of [[class consciousness]], leading to their conquest of political power and eventually the establishment of a classless, [[communist]] society constituted by a [[free association (communism and anarchism)|free association of producers]].<ref>Karl Marx: [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/index.htm ''Critique of the Gotha Program'']</ref> Marx actively fought for its implementation, arguing that the working class should carry out organised [[Revolution|revolutionary action]] to topple capitalism and bring about socio-economic [[emancipation]].<ref name="Calhoun2002-23-24" />

Marx has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history and his work has been both lauded and [[Criticisms of Marxism|criticised]].<ref name="Manchester"/> His work in economics laid the basis for much of the current understanding of labour and its relation to [[capital (economics)|capital]], and subsequent economic thought.<ref>[[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]].

Marx is typically cited as one of the principal architects of modern [[social science]].

==Life==

===Childhood and early education: 1818–1836===
Marx was born on 5 May 1818 to [[Heinrich Marx]] (1777–1838) and Henrietta Pressburg (1788–1863). He was born at Brückengasse 664 in [[Trier]], a town then part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]'s [[Grand Duchy of the Lower Rhine|Province of the Lower Rhine]].<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=7}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=8, 12}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=1}}.</ref> Marx was ancestrally Jewish as his maternal grandfather was a Dutch [[rabbi]], while his paternal line had supplied Trier's rabbis since 1723, a role taken by his grandfather Meier Halevi Marx.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976 |pp=4–5}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=7–9, 12}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=2–3}}.</ref> His father, as a child known as Herschel, was the first in the line to receive a secular education and he became a lawyer and lived a relatively wealthy and middle-class existence, with his family owning a number of [[Moselle wine|Moselle]] vineyards. Prior to his son's birth, and to escape the constraints of [[anti-Semitism|anti-semitic]] legislation, Herschel converted from [[Judaism]] to [[Lutheranism]], the main [[Protestant]] [[Christian denominations|denomination]] in Germany and Prussia at the time, taking on the German forename of Heinrich over the [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] Herschel.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=4–6}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=2–4}}.</ref> Marx was a third cousin once removed of German Romantic poet [[Heinrich Heine]], also born to a German Jewish family in the [[Rhineland]], with whom he became a frequent correspondent in later life.<ref>Raddatz ''Karl Marx: A Political Biography''</ref>{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

Largely non-religious, Heinrich was a man of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], interested in the ideas of the philosophers [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Voltaire]]. A [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]], he took part in agitation for a constitution and reforms in Prussia, then governed by an [[absolute monarchy]].<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=5, 8–12}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=11}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=5–6}}.</ref> In 1815, Heinrich Marx began work as an attorney and in 1819 moved his family to a ten-room property near the [[Porta Nigra]].<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=7}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=10}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=7}}.</ref> His wife, a Dutch Jewish woman, Henriette Pressburg, was from a prosperous business family that later founded the company [[Philips Electronics]]: she was great-aunt to [[Anton Philips|Anton]] and [[Gerard Philips]], as well as great-great-aunt to [[Frits Philips]].

Lion Philips was a wealthy Dutch tobacco manufacturer and industrialist, upon whom Karl and [[Jenny von Westphalen|Jenny Marx]] would later often come to rely for loans while they were exiled in London.<ref>''Francis Wheen, Karl Marx: A Life'', (Fourth Estate, 1999), {{ISBN|1-85702-637-3}}</ref>

By employing many [[Liberal humanism|liberal humanists]] as teachers, Wyttenbach incurred the anger of the local conservative government. Subsequently, police raided the school in 1832 and discovered that literature espousing political liberalism was being distributed among the students. Considering the distribution of such material a seditious act, the authorities instituted reforms and replaced several staff during Marx's attendance.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976 |pp=12–15}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=13}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=7–11}}.</ref>

In October 1835 at the age of 17, Marx travelled to the [[University of Bonn]] wishing to study philosophy and literature, but his father insisted on law as a more practical field.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976 |pp=15–16}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=14}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=13}}.</ref> Due to a condition referred to as a "weak chest",<ref>{{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=15}}.</ref> Marx was excused from military duty when he turned 18.

===Hegelianism and early activism: 1836–1843===
Spending summer and autumn 1836 in Trier, Marx became more serious about his studies and his life. He became engaged to Jenny von Westphalen, an educated baroness of the Prussian ruling class who had known Marx since childhood. As she had broken off her engagement with a young aristocrat to be with Marx, their relationship was socially controversial owing to the differences between their religious and class origins, but Marx befriended her father [[Ludwig von Westphalen]] (a liberal aristocrat) and later dedicated his doctoral thesis to him.<ref>{{harvnb|Fedoseyev|1973|p=23}}; {{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=23–30}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=16–21, 33}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=15, 20}}.</ref> Seven years after their engagement, on 19 June 1843 they got married in a Protestant church in [[Bad Kreuznach|Kreuznach]].<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=70–71}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=52–53}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=61–62}}.</ref>

In October 1836, Marx arrived in Berlin, matriculating in the university's faculty of law and renting a room in the Mittelstrasse.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=31}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=15}}.</ref> Although studying law, he was fascinated by philosophy and looked for a way to combine the two, believing that "without philosophy nothing could be accomplished".<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=33}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=21}}.</ref> Marx became interested in the recently deceased German philosopher [[G. W. F. Hegel]], whose ideas were then widely debated among European philosophical circles.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=32–34}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=21–22}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=21–22}}.</ref> During a convalescence in Stralau, he joined the Doctor's Club (''Doktorklub''), a student group which discussed Hegelian ideas and through them became involved with a group of [[Political radicalism|radical thinkers]] known as the [[Young Hegelians]] in 1837. They gathered around [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Ludwig Feuerbach]] and [[Bruno Bauer]], with Marx developing a particularly close friendship with Adolf Rutenberg. Like Marx, the Young Hegelians were critical of Hegel's [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] assumptions, but adopted his [[Marxist dialectic|dialectical method]] in order to criticise established society, politics and religion from a leftist perspective.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=34–38}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=34}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=25–27}}.</ref> Marx's father died in May 1838, resulting in a diminished income for the family.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=44,69–70}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=17–18}}.</ref> Marx had been emotionally close to his father and treasured his memory after his death.<ref>{{harvnb|Sperber|2013|pp=55–56}}.</ref>

[[File:Jenny Marx in green dress - painting.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Jenny von Westphalen]] in the 1830s]]
By 1837, Marx was writing both fiction and non-fiction, having completed a short novel, ''[[Scorpion and Felix]]'', a drama, ''[[Oulanem]]'', as well as a number of love poems dedicated to Jenny von Westphalen, though none of this early work was published during his lifetime.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=33}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=18–19}}. These love poems would be published posthumously in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 1'' (New York: International Publishers, 1975) pp. 531–632.</ref> Marx soon abandoned fiction for other pursuits, including the study of both English and Italian, [[art history]] and the translation of Latin classics.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=33}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=25–26}}.</ref> He began co-operating with [[Bruno Bauer]] on editing Hegel's ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion|Philosophy of Religion]]'' in 1840. Marx was also engaged in writing his doctoral thesis, ''[[The Difference Between the Democritean and Epicurean Philosophy of Nature]]'',<ref>Marx's thesis was posthumously published in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 1'' (New York: International Publishers, 1975) pp. 25–107.</ref> which he completed in 1841. It was described as "a daring and original piece of work in which Marx set out to show that theology must yield to the superior wisdom of philosophy".<ref>[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. p. 32.</ref> The essay was controversial, particularly among the conservative professors at the University of Berlin. Marx decided instead to submit his thesis to the more liberal [[University of Jena]], whose faculty awarded him his PhD in April 1841.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=45}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=33}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=28–29, 33}}.</ref> As Marx and Bauer were both [[atheism|atheists]], in March 1841 they began plans for a journal entitled ''Archiv des Atheismus'' (''Atheistic Archives''), but it never came to fruition. In July, Marx and Bauer took a trip to [[Bonn]] from Berlin. There they scandalised their class by getting drunk, laughing in church and galloping through the streets on donkeys.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=38–45}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=34}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=32–33, 37}}.</ref>

Marx was considering an academic career, but this path was barred by the government's growing opposition to classical liberalism and the Young Hegelians.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=49}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=33}}.</ref> Marx moved to [[Cologne]] in 1842, where he became a journalist, writing for the radical newspaper ''[[Rheinische Zeitung]]'' (''Rhineland News''), expressing his early views on socialism and his developing interest in economics. Marx criticised both right-wing European governments as well as figures in the liberal and socialist movements whom he thought ineffective or counter-productive.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=50–51}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=34–36, 42–44}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=35–47}}.</ref> The newspaper attracted the attention of the Prussian [[censorship|government censors]], who checked every issue for seditious material before printing, as Marx lamented: "Our newspaper has to be presented to the police to be sniffed at, and if the police nose smells anything un-Christian or un-Prussian, the newspaper is not allowed to appear".<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=57}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=47}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=48–50}}.</ref> After the ''Rheinische Zeitung'' published an article strongly criticising the Russian monarchy, Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] requested it be banned and Prussia's government complied in 1843.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=60–61}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=47–48}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=50–51}}.</ref>

===Paris: 1843–1845===
In 1843, Marx became co-editor of a new, radical leftist Parisian newspaper, the ''[[Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher]]'' (''German-French Annals''), then being set up by the German socialist [[Arnold Ruge]] to bring together German and French radicals<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=68–69, 72}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=48}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=59–61}}</ref> and thus Marx and his wife moved to Paris in October 1843. Initially living with Ruge and his wife communally at 23 [[Rue Vaneau]], they found the living conditions difficult, so moved out following the birth of their daughter Jenny in 1844.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=77–79}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=62–66}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=73–74, 94}}.</ref> Although intended to attract writers from both France and the German states, the ''Jahrbücher'' was dominated by the latter and the only non-German writer was the exiled Russian [[Collectivist anarchism|anarchist collectivist]] [[Mikhail Bakunin]].<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=72}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=64–65}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=71–72}}.</ref> Marx contributed two essays to the paper, "[[Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right|Introduction to a Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right]]"<ref>Marx, Karl, "Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Law", contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 3'' (International Publishers: New York, 1975) p. 3.</ref> and "[[On the Jewish Question]]",<ref>Marx, Karl, "On the Jewish Question", contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 3'', p. 146.</ref>  the latter introducing his belief that the [[proletariat]] were a revolutionary force and marking his embrace of communism.<ref>{{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=65–70, 74–80}}.</ref> Only one issue was published, but it was relatively successful, largely owing to the inclusion of [[Heinrich Heine]]'s satirical odes on King [[Ludwig I of Bavaria|Ludwig of Bavaria]], leading the German states to ban it and seize imported copies (Ruge nevertheless refused to fund the publication of further issues and his friendship with Marx broke down).<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=72, 75–76}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=65}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=88–90}}.</ref> After the paper's collapse, Marx began writing for the only uncensored German-language radical newspaper left, ''[[Vorwärts!]]'' (''Forward!''). Based in Paris, the paper was connected to the [[League of the Just]], a [[utopian socialism|utopian socialist]] secret society of workers and artisans. Marx attended some of their meetings, but did not join.<ref>{{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=66–67, 112}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=79–80}}.</ref> In ''Vorwärts!'', Marx refined his views on socialism based upon Hegelian and Feuerbachian ideas of dialectical materialism, at the same time criticising liberals and other socialists operating in Europe.<ref>{{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=90}}.</ref>

XII</ref> and would result in his major economic work—the three-volume series called ''Capital''.<ref>Karl Marx, ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35'', ''Volume 36'' and ''Volume 37'' (International Publishers: New York, 1996, 1997 and 1987).</ref> [[Marxism]] is based in large part on three influences: [[Hegel]]'s dialectics, French utopian socialism and English economics. Together with his earlier study of Hegel's dialectics, the studying that Marx did during this time in Paris meant that all major components of "Marxism" (or political economy as Marx called it) were in place by the autumn of 1844.<ref>Isaiah Berlin, ''Karl Marx: His Life and Environment'', pp. 35–61.</ref>  Although Marx was constantly being pulled away from his study of political economy by the usual daily demands on his time that everyone faces and the additional special demands of editing a radical newspaper and later by the demands of organising and directing the efforts of a political party during years in which popular uprisings of the citizenry might at any moment become a revolution, Marx was always drawn back to his economic studies. Marx sought "to understand the inner workings of capitalism".<ref>P. N. Fedoseyev, ''et al.'', ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', p. 62.</ref>

An outline of "Marxism" had definitely formed in the mind of Karl Marx by late 1844. Indeed, many features of the Marxist view of the world's political economy had been worked out in great detail, but Marx needed to write down all of the details of his economic world view to further clarify the new economic theory in his own mind.<ref>Note 54 contained on page 598 in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 3''.</ref> Accordingly, Marx wrote ''[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844|The Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts]]''.<ref>Karl Marx, "Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844" ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 3'' (International Publishers: New York, 1975) pp. 229–346.</ref> These manuscripts covered numerous topics, detailing Marx's concept of [[alienated labour]].<ref name=sep/> However, by the spring of 1845 his continued study of political economy, capital and capitalism had led Marx to the belief that the new political economic theory that he was espousing—scientific socialism—needed to be built on the base of a thoroughly developed materialistic view of the world.<ref>P. N. Fedoseyev, ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', p. 83.</ref>

The ''Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844'' had been written between April and August 1844, but soon Marx recognised that the ''Manuscripts'' had been influenced by some inconsistent ideas of Ludwig Feuerbach.  Accordingly, Marx recognised the need to break with Feuerbach's philosophy in favour of historical materialism, thus a year later (in April 1845) after moving from Paris to Brussels, Marx wrote his eleven "[[Theses on Feuerbach]]".<ref>Karl Marx, "Theses on Feuerbach", contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 5'' (International Publishers: New York, 1976) pp. 3–14.</ref>  The "Theses on Feuerbach" are best known for Thesis 11, which states that "philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways, the point is to change it".<ref name=sep/><ref>Karl Marx, "Theses on Feuerbach," contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 5'', p. 8.</ref> This work contains Marx's criticism of [[materialism]] (for being contemplative), [[idealism]] (for reducing practice to theory) overall, criticising philosophy for putting abstract reality above the physical world.<ref name=sep/> It thus introduced the first glimpse at Marx's [[historical materialism]], an argument that the world is changed not by ideas but by actual, physical, material activity and practice.<ref name=sep/><ref name="Engels1999"/> In 1845, after receiving a request from the Prussian king, the French government shut down ''Vorwärts!'', with the interior minister, [[François Guizot]], expelling Marx from France.<ref name="Wheen 2001. p. 90"/> At this point, Marx moved from Paris to Brussels, where Marx hoped to once again continue his study of capitalism and political economy.

===Brussels: 1845–1848===
[[File:Communist-manifesto.png|thumb|The first edition of ''[[The Communist Manifesto|The Manifesto of the Communist Party]]'', published in German in 1848]]
Unable either to stay in France or to move to Germany, Marx decided to emigrate to Brussels in Belgium in February 1845. However, to stay in Belgium he had to pledge not to publish anything on the subject of contemporary politics.<ref name="Wheen 2001. p. 90"/> In Brussels, Marx associated with other exiled socialists from across Europe, including [[Moses Hess]], [[Karl Heinzen]] and [[Joseph Weydemeyer]]. In April 1845, Engels moved from Barmen in Germany to Brussels to join Marx and the growing cadre of members of the League of the Just now seeking home in Brussels.<ref name="Wheen 2001. p. 90" /><ref>Heinrich Gemkow ''et al.'', ''Frederick Engels: A Biography'' (Verlag Zeit im Bild ["New Book Publishing House"]: Dresden, 1972) p. 101</ref> Later, Mary Burns, Engels' long-time companion, left Manchester, England to join Engels in Brussels.<ref>Heinrich Gemkow, ''et al.'', ''Frederick Engels: A Biography'', p. 102.</ref>

In mid-July 1845, Marx and Engels left Brussels for England to visit the leaders of the [[Chartism|Chartists]], a socialist movement in Britain. This was Marx's first trip to England and Engels was an ideal guide for the trip. Engels had already spent two years living in Manchester from November 1842<ref>Heinrich Gemkow, ''et al.'', ''Frederick Engels: A Biography'' (Verlag Zeit im Bild [New Book Publishing House]: Dresden, 1972) p. 53</ref> to August 1844.<ref>Heinrich Gemkow, ''et al.'', ''Frederick Engels: A Biography'', p. 78.</ref> Not only did Engels already know the English language,<ref name="N. Fedoseyev, p. 89">P. N. Fedoseyev, ''et al.'', ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', p. 89.</ref> he had also developed a close relationship with many Chartist leaders.<ref name="N. Fedoseyev, p. 89"/> Indeed, Engels was serving as a reporter for many Chartist and socialist English newspapers.<ref name="N. Fedoseyev, p. 89"/> Marx used the trip as an opportunity to examine the economic resources available for study in various libraries in London and Manchester.<ref>[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. p. 92.</ref>

In collaboration with Engels, Marx also set about writing a book which is often seen as his best treatment of the concept of [[historical materialism]], ''[[The German Ideology]]''.<ref>Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, "German Ideology" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 5'' (International Publishers: New York, 1976) pp. 19–539.</ref> In this work, Marx broke with [[Ludwig Feuerbach]], [[Bruno Bauer]], [[Max Stirner]] and the rest of the Young Hegelians, while he also broke with [[Karl Grun]] and other "true socialists" whose philosophies were still based in part on "idealism". In ''German Ideology'', Marx and Engels finally completed their philosophy, which was based solely on materialism as the sole motor force in history.<ref>P. N. Fedoseyev, ''et al.'', ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', pp. 96–97.</ref> ''German Ideology'' is written in a humorously satirical form, but even this satirical form did not save the work from censorship. Like so many other early writings of his, ''German Ideology'' would not be published in Marx's lifetime and would be published only in 1932.<ref name="sep"/><ref name="wk"/><ref>[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. p. 93.</ref>

After completing ''German Ideology'', Marx turned to a work that was intended to clarify his own position regarding "the theory and tactics" of a truly "revolutionary proletarian movement" operating from the standpoint of a truly "scientific materialist" philosophy.<ref>See Note 71 on p. 672 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 6'' (International Publishers: New York, 1976).</ref> This work was intended to draw a distinction between the utopian socialists and Marx's own scientific socialist philosophy. Whereas the utopians believed that people must be persuaded one person at a time to join the socialist movement, the way a person must be persuaded to adopt any different belief, Marx knew that people would tend on most occasions to act in accordance with their own economic interests, thus appealing to an entire class (the working class in this case) with a broad appeal to the class's best material interest would be the best way to mobilise the broad mass of that class to make a revolution and change society. This was the intent of the new book that Marx was planning, but to get the manuscript past the government censors he called the book ''[[The Poverty of Philosophy]]'' (1847)<ref>Karl Marx, ''The Poverty of Philosophy'' contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 6''(International Publishers: New York, 1976) pp. 105–212.</ref> and offered it as a response to the "petty bourgeois philosophy" of the French anarchist socialist [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] as expressed in his book ''[[The Philosophy of Poverty]]'' (1840).<ref>[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. p. 107.</ref>

[[File:Marx+Family and Engels.jpg|thumb|right|180|Marx, Engels and Marx's daughters]]
These books laid the foundation for Marx and Engels's most famous work, a political pamphlet that has since come to be commonly known as ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]''. While residing in Brussels in 1846, Marx continued his association with the secret radical organisation [[League of the Just]].<ref>P. N. Fedoseyev, ''Karl Marx: A Biography'' (Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1973) p. 124.</ref> As noted above, Marx thought the League to be just the sort of radical organisation that was needed to spur the working class of Europe toward the mass movement that would bring about a working class revolution.<ref>Note 260 contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11'' (International Publishers: New York, 1979) pp. 671–672.</ref> However, to organise the working class into a mass movement the League had to cease its "secret" or "underground" orientation and operate in the open as a political party.<ref>Note 260 contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11'', p. 672.</ref> Members of the League eventually became persuaded in this regard. Accordingly, in June 1847 the League was reorganised by its membership into a new open "above ground" political society that appealed directly to the working classes.<ref>P. N. Fedoseyev,''et al.'', ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', pp. 123–125.</ref> This new open political society was called the Communist League.<ref>P. N. Fedoseyev, ''et al'', ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', p. 125.</ref> Both Marx and Engels participated in drawing the programme and organisational principles of the new [[Communist League]].<ref>Frederick Engels, "Principles of Communism" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 6'' (International Publishers, New York, 1976) pp. 341–357.</ref>

In late 1847, Marx and Engels began writing what was to become their most famous work — a programme of action for the [[Communist League]]. Written jointly by Marx and Engels from December 1847 to January 1848, ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' was first published on 21 February 1848.<ref>Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, "The Communist Manifesto" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 6'', pp. 477–519.</ref> ''The Communist Manifesto'' laid out the beliefs of the new Communist League. No longer a secret society, the Communist League wanted to make aims and intentions clear to the general public rather than hiding its beliefs as the League of the Just had been doing.<ref>[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. p. 115.</ref> The opening lines of the pamphlet set forth the principal basis of Marxism: "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles".<ref name="ShillingMellor2001">{{cite book|author1=Chris Shilling|author2=Philip A Mellor|title=The Sociological Ambition: Elementary Forms of Social and Moral Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1CdgJe9Jx0UC&pg=PA114|year=2001|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-0-7619-6549-7|page=114}}</ref> It goes on to examine the antagonisms that Marx claimed were arising in the clashes of interest between the [[bourgeoisie]] (the wealthy capitalist class) and the [[proletariat]] (the industrial working class). Proceeding on from this, the ''Manifesto'' presents the argument for why the Communist League, as opposed to other socialist and liberal political parties and groups at the time, was truly acting in the interests of the proletariat to overthrow capitalist society and to replace it with socialism.<ref>[[#Mar48|Marx and Engels 1848]].</ref>

Later that year, Europe experienced a series of protests, rebellions and often violent upheavals that became known as the [[Revolutions of 1848]].<ref name="Wheen 2001. p. 125"/> In France, [[French Revolution of 1848|a revolution]] led to the overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the [[French Second Republic]].<ref name="Wheen 2001. p. 125"/> Marx was supportive of such activity and having recently received a substantial inheritance from his father (withheld by his uncle Lionel Philips since his father's death in 1838) of either 6,000<ref name="MaltsevN.-93"/> or 5,000 francs<ref>Saul Kussiel Padover, ''Karl Marx, an intimate biography'', McGraw-Hill, 1978, page 205</ref><ref name="ReferenceA"/> he allegedly used a third of it to arm [[Belgium|Belgian]] workers who were planning revolutionary action.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Although the veracity of these allegations is disputed,<ref name="MaltsevN.-93"/><ref>David McLellan 1973 ''Karl Marx: His life and Thought''.

===Cologne: 1848–1849===
Temporarily settling down in Paris, Marx transferred the Communist League executive headquarters to the city and also set up a [[German Workers' Club]] with various German socialists living there.<ref>[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. p. 128.</ref> Hoping to see the revolution spread to Germany, in 1848 Marx moved back to Cologne where he began issuing a handbill entitled the ''Demands of the Communist Party in Germany'',<ref>Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, "Demands of the Communist Party" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 7'' (International Publishers: New York, 1977) pp. 3–6.</ref>  in which he argued for only four of the ten points of the ''Communist Manifesto'', believing that in Germany at that time the bourgeoisie must overthrow the [[feudalism|feudal]] monarchy and aristocracy before the proletariat could overthrow the bourgeoisie.<ref>[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. p. 129.</ref> On 1 June, Marx started publication of a daily newspaper, the ''[[Neue Rheinische Zeitung]]'', which he helped to finance through his recent inheritance from his father. Designed to put forward news from across Europe with his own Marxist interpretation of events, the newspaper featured Marx as a primary writer and the dominant editorial influence. Despite contributions by fellow members of the Communist League, according to [[Friedrich Engels]] it remained "a simple dictatorship by Marx".<ref>[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. pp. 130–132.</ref><ref>Seigel, p. 50</ref><ref name="DL-Marx"/>

Whilst editor of the paper, Marx and the other revolutionary socialists were regularly harassed by the police and Marx was brought to trial on several occasions, facing various allegations including insulting the Chief Public Prosecutor, committing a press misdemeanor and inciting armed rebellion through tax boycotting,<ref name="ReferenceB"/><ref name="Nicolaievsky2007"/><ref name="Splichal2002"/><ref name="Mehring2003"/> although each time he was acquitted.<ref name="Nicolaievsky2007"/><ref name="Mehring2003"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Gross|first=David M.|year=2014|title=99 Tactics of Successful Tax Resistance Campaigns|publisher=Picket Line Press|isbn=978-1490572741|pages=76–77}}</ref> Meanwhile, the democratic parliament in [[Prussia]] collapsed and the king, [[Frederick William IV]], introduced a new cabinet of his reactionary supporters, who implemented counter-revolutionary measures to expunge leftist and other revolutionary elements from the country.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> Consequently, the ''Neue Rheinische Zeitung'' was soon suppressed and Marx was ordered to leave the country on 16 May.<ref name="DL-Marx"/><ref>[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. pp. 137–146.</ref> Marx returned to Paris, which was then under the grip of both a reactionary counter-revolution and a [[cholera]] epidemic and was soon expelled by the city authorities, who considered him a political threat. With his wife Jenny expecting their fourth child and not able to move back to Germany or Belgium, in August 1849 he sought refuge in London.<ref>[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. pp. 147–148.</ref><ref name="Watson2010"/>

===Move to London and further writing: 1850–1860===
Marx moved to London in early June 1849 and would remain based in the city for the rest of his life. The headquarters of the Communist League also moved to London. However, in the winter of 1849–1850 a split within the ranks of the Communist League occurred when a faction within it led by [[August Willich]] and [[Karl Schapper]] began agitating for an immediate uprising. Willich and Schapper believed that once the Communist League had initiated the uprising, the entire working class from across Europe would rise "spontaneously" to join it, thus creating revolution across Europe. Marx and Engels protested that such an unplanned uprising on the part of the Communist League was "adventuristic" and would be suicide for the Communist League.<ref name="N. Fedoseyev, p. 233">P. N. Fedoseyev, ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', p. 233.</ref> Such an uprising as that recommended by the Schapper/Willich group would easily be crushed by the police and the armed forces of the reactionary governments of Europe. Marx maintained that this would spell doom for the Communist League itself, arguing that changes in society are not achieved overnight through the efforts and will power of  a handful of men.<ref name="N. Fedoseyev, p. 233"/> They are instead brought about through a scientific analysis of economic conditions of society and by moving toward revolution through different stages of social development. In the present stage of development (''circa'' 1850), following the defeat of the uprisings across Europe in 1848 he felt that the Communist League should encourage the working class to unite with progressive elements of the rising bourgeoisie to defeat the feudal aristocracy on issues involving demands for governmental reforms, such as a constitutional republic with freely elected assemblies and universal (male) suffrage. In other words, the working class must join with bourgeois and democratic forces to bring about the successful conclusion of the bourgeois revolution before stressing the working class agenda and a working class revolution.

After a long struggle which threatened to ruin the Communist League, Marx's opinion prevailed and eventually the Willich/Schapper group left the Communist League. Meanwhile, Marx also became heavily involved with the socialist German Workers' Educational Society.<ref>Note 269 contained on page 674 in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11''.</ref> The Society held their meetings in [[Great Windmill Street]], [[Soho]], central London's entertainment district.<ref>[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. pp. 151–155.</ref><ref name="Harriss2006"/> This organisation was also racked by an internal struggle between its members, some of whom followed Marx while others followed the Schapper/Willich faction. The issues in this internal split were the same issues raised in the internal split within the Communist League, but Marx lost the fight with the Schapper/Willich faction within the German Workers' Educational Society and on 17 September 1850 resigned from the Society.<ref>Note 269 on page 674 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11''.</ref>

===''New York Tribune'' and journalism ===
While in London, Marx devoted himself to the task of revolutionary organising of the working class. For the first few years, he and his family lived in extreme poverty.<ref name="DusselMoseley2001"/><ref name="egsbio"/> His main source of income was his colleague Engels, who derived much of his income from his family's business.<ref name=egsbio/> Later, Marx and Engels both began writing for six different newspapers around the world in England, the United States, [[Prussia]], Austria and South Africa.<ref>Jonathan Sperber, ''Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century Life'', p. 295.</ref> However, most of Marx's journalistic writing was as a European correspondent for the ''[[New York Daily Tribune]]''.<ref>Richard Kluger, ''The Paper: The Life and Death of the New York Herald Tribune'' (Alfred A. Knoft Publishing Co.: New York, 1986) p. 17.</ref> In earlier years, Marx had been able to communicate with the broad masses of the working class by editing his own newspaper or editing a newspaper financed by others sympathetic to his philosophy. Now in London, Marx was unable to finance his own newspaper and unable to put together financing from others, thus Marx sought to communicate with the public by writing articles for the ''New York Tribune'' and other "bourgeois" newspapers. At first, Marx's English-language articles were translated from German by {{Interlanguage link multi|Wilhelm Pieper (revolutionary)|de|3=Wilhelm Pieper (Revolutionär)|lt=Wilhelm Pieper}}, but eventually Marx learned English well enough to write without translation.<ref name="Dispatches"/>

The ''New York Daily Tribune'' had been founded in New York City in the United States by [[Horace Greeley]] in April 1841.<ref>P. N. Fedoseyev, ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', 274.</ref> Marx's main contact on the ''Tribune'' was [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles Dana]]. Later in 1868, Charles Dana would leave the ''Tribune'' to become the owner and editor-in-chief of the ''New York Sun'', a competing newspaper in New York City.<ref>Richard Kluger, ''The Paper: The Life and Death of the New York Herald Tribune'' (Alfred A. Knopt Publishing, New York, 1986) p. 121.</ref> However, at this time Charles Dana served on the editorial board of the ''Tribune''.

Several characteristics about the ''Tribune'' made the newspaper an excellent vehicle for Marx to reach a sympathetic public across the Atlantic Ocean. Since its founding, the ''Tribune'' had been an inexpensive newspaper—two cents per copy.<ref>Taken from a picture on page 327 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11'' (International Publishers: New York, 1979).</ref> Accordingly, it was popular with the broad masses of the working class of the United States. With a run of about 50,000 issues, the ''Tribune'' was the most widely circulated journal in the United States.<ref>Richard Kluger, ''The Paper: The Life and Death of the New York Herald Tribune'', p. 14.</ref> Editorially, the ''Tribune'' reflected Greeley's anti-slavery opinions.<ref>Richard Kluger, ''The Paper: The Life and Death of the New York Herald Tribune'' (Alfred A. Knoft: New York, 1986), p, 82.</ref> Not only did the ''Tribune'' have wide readership with the United States and not only did that readership come from the working classes, but the readers seemed to be from the progressive wing of the working class. Marx's first article for the ''New York Tribune'' was on the British elections to Parliament and was published in the ''Tribune'' on 21 August 1852.<ref>Karl Marx, "The Elections in England – Tories and Whigs" contained in the''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11'' (International Publishers: New York, 1979) pp. 327–332.</ref>

Marx was just one of the reporters in Europe that the ''New York Tribune'' employed. However, with the slavery crisis in the United States coming to a head in the late 1850s and with the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] in 1861, the American public's interest in European affairs declined.<ref>Note 1 at page 367 contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 19'' (International Publishers: New York, 1984).</ref> Thus Marx very early began to write on issues affecting the United States — particularly the "slavery crisis" and the "War Between the States".

From December 1851 to March 1852, Marx wrote ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]]'',<ref>Karl Marx, "The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon" contained in the ''Collected Works of KarlMarx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11'' (International Publishers: New York, 1979) pp. 99–197.</ref> a work on the [[French Revolution of 1848]] in which he expanded upon his concepts of historical materialism, [[class struggle]] and the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], advancing the argument that victorious proletariat has to smash the [[bourgeois]] state.<ref name="Marx2008"/>

The 1850s and 1860s also mark the line between what some scholars see as the [[idealistic]], Hegelian [[young Marx]] from the more scientifically minded [[mature Marx]] writings of the later period.<ref name="Wood"/><ref name="Wood1993"/><ref name="Hook1994"/><ref name="Johnston2000"/> This distinction is usually associated with the [[structural Marxism]] school<ref name="Johnston2000"/> and not all scholars agree that it exists.<ref name="Hook1994"/><ref name="GeorgeScanlan1975"/> The years of revolution from 1848 to 1849 had been a grand experience for both Marx and Engels. They both became sure that their economic view of the course of history was the only valid way that historic events like the revolutionary upsurge of 1848 could be adequately explained. For some time after 1848, Marx and Engels wondered if the entire revolutionary upsurge had completely played out. As time passed, they began to think that a new revolutionary upsurge would not occur until there was another economic downturn. The question of whether a recession would be necessary to create a new [[revolutionary situation]] in society became a point of contention between Marx and certain other revolutionaries. Marx accused these other revolutionaries of being "adventurists" because of their belief that a revolutionary situation could be created out of thin air by the sheer "will power" of the revolutionaries without regard to the economic realities of the current situation.

The downturn in the United States economy in 1852 led Marx and Engels to wonder if a revolutionary upsurge would soon occur. However, the United States' economy was too new to play host to a classical revolution. The western frontier in America always provided a relief valve for the pent-up forces that might in other countries cause social unrest. Any economic crisis which began in the United States would not lead to revolution unless one of the older economies of Europe "caught the contagion" from the United States. In other words, economies of the world were still seen as individual national systems which were contiguous with the national borders of each country. The [[Panic of 1857]] broke the mould of all prior thinking on the world economy. Beginning in the United States, the Panic spread across the globe.<ref>Jonathan Sperber, ''Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century'', p. 320.</ref> Indeed, the Panic of 1857 was the first truly global economic crisis.

Marx longed to return to his economic studies, as he had left these studies in 1844 and had been preoccupied with other projects over the last thirteen years. By returning to his study of economics, Marx felt he would be able to understand more thoroughly what was occurring in the world.

===The First International and ''Capital''===
Marx continued to write articles for the ''New York Daily Tribune'' as long as he was sure that the ''Tribune's'' editorial policy was still progressive. However, the departure of Charles Dana from the paper in late 1861 and the resultant change in the editorial board brought about a new editorial policy.<ref>Jonathan Sperber, ''Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century Life'', p. 347.</ref> No longer was the ''Tribune'' to be a strong [[abolitionist]] paper dedicated to a complete [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] victory. The new editorial board supported an immediate peace between the Union and the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] in the Civil War in the United States with slavery left intact in the Confederacy. Marx strongly disagreed with this new political position and in 1863 was forced to withdraw as a writer for the ''Tribune.''<ref>P. N. Fedoseyev ''et al.'', ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', p. 345.</ref>

In 1864, Marx became involved in the [[International Workingmen's Association]] (also known as ''First International''),<ref name="Nicolaievsky2007"/> to whose General Council he was elected at its inception in 1864.<ref name="Nicolaievsky2007-267"/> In that organisation, Marx was involved in the struggle against the anarchist wing centred on [[Mikhail Bakunin]] (1814–1876).<ref name=egsbio/> Although Marx won this contest, the transfer of the seat of the General Council from London to New York in 1872, which Marx supported, led to the decline of the International.<ref name="JessopWheatley1999-526"/> The most important political event during the existence of the International was the [[Paris Commune]] of 1871, when the citizens of Paris rebelled against their government and held the city for two months. In response to the bloody suppression of this rebellion, Marx wrote one of his most famous pamphlets, "[[The Civil War in France]]", a defence of the Commune.<ref name="Curtis1997"/><ref>Karl Marx, "The Civil War in France" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 22'' (International Publishers: New York, 1986) pp. 307–359.</ref>

Given the repeated failures and frustrations of workers' revolutions and movements, Marx also sought to understand capitalism and spent a great deal of time in the reading room of the [[British Museum]] studying and reflecting on the works of [[political economy|political economists]] and on economic data.<ref name="Calhoun2002-20"/> By 1857, Marx had accumulated over 800 pages of notes and short essays on capital, [[landed property]], wage labour, the state and foreign trade and the world market, though this work did not appear in print until 1939 under the title ''[[Grundrisse|''Outlines of the Critique of Political Economy'']]''.<ref name="Segrest2002"/><ref>Karl Marx, "Economic Manuscripts of 1857–1858" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 28'' (International Publishers: New York, 1986) pp. 5–537.</ref><ref>Karl Marx, "Economic Manuscripts of 1857–1858" contained in the Preparatory Materials section of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 29'' (International Publishers: New York, 1987) pp. 421–507.</ref>

Finally in 1859, Marx published ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]]'',<ref>Karl Marx, "A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 29'', pp. 257–417.</ref> his first serious economic work. This work was intended merely as a preview of his three-volume ''[[Das Kapital]]'' (English title: ''Capital: Critique of Political Economy''), which he intended to publish at a later date. In ''A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy'', Marx accepts the [[labour theory of value]] as advocated by [[David Ricardo]], but whereas Ricardo drew a distinction between [[use value]] and [[value (economics)|value]] in commodities, Ricardo always had been unable to define the real relationship between use value and value. The reasoning Marx laid out in his book clearly delineated the true relationship between use value and value.<ref>Karl Marx, "A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 29'', pp. 269–302.</ref> He also produced a truly scientific theory of money and money circulation in the capitalist economy,<ref>Karl Marx, "A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 29'', pp. 303–417.</ref> thus ''A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy'' created a storm of enthusiasm when it appeared in public and the entire edition of the book was sold out quickly.<ref>P. N. Fedoseyev, ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', p. 318.</ref>

The successful sales of ''A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy'' stimulated Marx in the early 1860s to finish work on the three large volumes that would compose his major life's work—''Das Kapital'' and the ''[[Theories of Surplus Value]]'', which discussed the theoreticians of political economy, particularly [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Ricardo]].<ref name=egsbio/> ''Theories of Surplus Value'' is often referred to as the fourth volume book of ''Das Kapital'' and constitutes one of the first comprehensive treatises on the [[history of economic thought]].<ref name="Rockmore2002"/> In 1867, the first volume of ''Das Kapital'' was published, a work which analysed the capitalist process of production.<ref name="BrewerMarx1984-15"/> Here Marx elaborated his [[labour theory of value]], which had been influenced by [[Thomas Hodgskin]]. Marx acknowledged Hodgskin's "admirable work" ''Labour Defended against the Claims of Capital'' at more than one point in ''Capital.''<ref>See footnote #2 on the bottom of page 360 in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35''.</ref> Indeed, Marx quoted Hodgskin as recognising the alienation of labour that occurred under modern capitalist production. No longer was there any "natural reward of individual labour. Each labourer produces only some part of a whole, and each part having no value or utility of itself, there is nothing on which the labourer can seize, and say: 'This is my product, this will I keep to myself'".<ref>Thomas Hodgskin, ''Labour Defended against the Claims of Capital'' (London, 1825) p. 25.</ref> In this first volume of ''Capital'', Marx outlined his conception of [[surplus value]] and [[Exploit (sociology)|exploitation]], which he argued would ultimately lead to a falling rate of profit and the collapse of industrial capitalism.<ref name="Calhoun2002-23"/> Demand for a Russian language edition of ''Capital'' soon led to the printing of 3,000 copies of the book in the Russian language, which was published on 27 March 1872. By the autumn of 1871, the entire first edition of the German language edition of ''Capital'' had been sold out and a second edition was published.

Volumes II and III of ''Capital'' remained mere manuscripts upon which Marx continued to work for the rest of his life. Both volumes were published by Engels after Marx's death.<ref name=egsbio/> Volume II of ''Capital'' was prepared and published by Engels in July 1893 under the name ''Capital II: The Process of Circulation of Capital''.<ref>Karl Marx, "Capital II: The Process of Circulation of Capital" embodying the whole volume of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 36'' (International Publishers: New York, 1997).</ref> Volume III of ''Capital'' was published a year later in October 1894 under the name ''Capital III: The Process of Capitalist Production as a Whole''.<ref>Karl Marx, "Capital III: The Process of Capitalist Production as a Whole" embodying the whole volume of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 37'' (International Publishers: New York, 1998).</ref> ''Theories of Surplus Value'' was developed from the ''Economic Manuscripts of 1861–1863'' which comprise Volumes 30, 31 32 and 33 of the ''Collected Works of Marx and Engels'' and from the ''Economic Manuscripts of 1861–1864'' which comprises Volume 34 of the ''Collected Works of Marx and Engels.'' The exact part of the ''Economic Manuscripts of 1861–1863'' which makes up the ''Theories of Surplus Value'' are the last part of Volume 30 of the ''Collected Works'',<ref>Karl Marx, "Theories of Surplus Value" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 30'' (International Publishers: New York, 1988) pp. 318–451.</ref> the whole of Volume 31 of the ''Collected Works''<ref>Karl Marx, "Theories of Surplus Value" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 31'' (International Publishers: New York, 1989) pp. 5–580.</ref> and the whole of Volume 32 of the ''Collected Works''.<ref>Karl Marx, "Theories of Surplus Value" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 32'' (International Publishers: New York, 1989) pp. 5–543.</ref> A German language abridged edition of ''Theories of Surplus Value'' was published in 1905 and in 1910. This abridged edition was translated into English and published in 1951 in London, but the complete unabridged edition of ''Theories of Surplus Value'' was published as the "fourth volume" of ''Capital'' in 1963 and 1971 in Moscow.<ref>See note 228 on page 475 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 30''.</ref>

[[File:Marx old.jpg|thumb|Marx in 1882]]
During the last decade of his life, Marx's health declined and he became incapable of the sustained effort that had characterised his previous work.<ref name=egsbio/> He did manage to comment substantially on contemporary politics, particularly in Germany and Russia. His ''[[Critique of the Gotha Programme]]'' opposed the tendency of his followers [[Wilhelm Liebknecht]] and [[August Bebel]] to compromise with the [[state socialism]] of [[Ferdinand Lassalle]] in the interests of a united socialist party.<ref name=egsbio/> This work is also notable for another famous Marx quote: "[[From each according to his ability, to each according to his need]]".<ref name="CGP P1"/>

In a letter to [[Vera Zasulich]] dated 8 March 1881, Marx contemplated the possibility of Russia's bypassing the capitalist stage of development and building communism on the basis of the common ownership of land characteristic of the village ''[[mir (social)|mir]]''.<ref name=egsbio/><ref>Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, ''Collected Works Volume 46'' (International Publishers: New York, 1992) p. 71.</ref> While admitting that Russia's rural "commune is the fulcrum of social regeneration in Russia", Marx also warned that in order for the mir to operate as a means for moving straight to the socialist stage without a preceding capitalist stage it "would first be necessary to eliminate the deleterious influences which are assailing it (the rural commune) from all sides".<ref name="k72"/> Given the elimination of these pernicious influences, Marx allowed that "normal conditions of spontaneous development" of the rural commune could exist.<ref name=k72/> However, in the same letter to Vera Zasulich he points out that "at the core of the capitalist system&nbsp;... lies the complete separation of the producer from the means of production".<ref name=k72/> In one of the drafts of this letter, Marx reveals his growing passion for anthropology, motivated by his belief that future communism would be a return on a higher level to the communism of our prehistoric past. He wrote that "the historical trend of our age is the fatal crisis which capitalist production has undergone in the European and American countries where it has reached its highest peak, a crisis that will end in its destruction, in the return of modern society to a higher form of the most archaic type—collective production and appropriation". He added that "the vitality of primitive communities was incomparably greater than that of Semitic, Greek, Roman, ''etc''. societies, and, a fortiori, that of modern capitalist societies".<ref>K. Marx, First draft of letter to Vera Zasulich [1881]. In Marx-Engels 'Collected Works', Volume 24, p. 346.</ref> Before he died, Marx asked Engels to write up these ideas, which were published in 1884 under the title ''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State]]''.

==Personal life==

===Family===
[[File:Jenny laura marx.jpg|thumb|Jenny Carolina and Jenny Laura Marx (1869), as all the Marx daughters were named in honour of their mother Jenny von Westphalen)]]
Marx and von Westphalen had seven children together, but partly owing to the poor conditions in which they lived whilst in London, only three survived to adulthood.<ref>Peter Singer (2000). Marx a very short introduction. pp. 5. {{ISBN|0-19-285405-4}}</ref> The children were: [[Jenny Longuet|Jenny Caroline]] (m. Longuet; 1844–1883); [[Laura Marx|Jenny Laura]] (m. Lafargue; 1845–1911); Edgar (1847–1855); Henry Edward Guy ("Guido"; 1849–1850); Jenny Eveline Frances ("Franziska"; 1851–1852); [[Eleanor Marx|Jenny Julia Eleanor]] (1855–1898) and one more who died before being named (July 1857). There are allegations that Marx also fathered a son, Freddy,<ref name=Montefiore>{{cite news |last=Montefiore|first=Simon Sebag|title=The Means of Reproduction|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/25/books/review/love-and-capital-by-mary-gabriel-book-review.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=25 September 2011}}</ref> out of wedlock by his housekeeper, [[Helene Demuth]].<ref name="Karl Marx"/>

Marx frequently used pseudonyms, often when renting a house or flat, apparently to make it harder for the authorities to track him down. While in Paris, he used that of "Monsieur Ramboz", whilst in London he signed off his letters as "A. Williams". His friends referred to him as "Moor", owing to his dark complexion and black curly hair, while he encouraged his children to call him "Old Nick" and "Charley".<ref name="Wheen 2001. p. 152"/> He also bestowed nicknames and pseudonyms on his friends and family as well, referring to Friedrich Engels as "General", his housekeeper Helene as "Lenchen" or "Nym", while one of his daughters, Jennychen, was referred to as "Qui Qui, [[Emperor of China]]" and another, Laura, was known as "[[Cockatoo|Kakadou]]" or "the [[Khoikhoi|Hottentot]]".<ref name="Wheen 2001. p. 152"/>

===Health===
Marx was afflicted by poor health (what he himself described as "the wretchedness of existence")<ref>Blumenberg, 98.</ref> and various authors have sought to describe and explain it. His biographer Werner Blumenberg attributed it to liver and gall problems which Marx had in 1849 and from which he was never afterwards free, exacerbated by an unsuitable lifestyle. The attacks often came with headaches, eye inflammation, neuralgia in the head and rheumatic pains. A serious nervous disorder appeared in 1877 and protracted insomnia was a consequence, which Marx fought with narcotics. The illness was aggravated by excessive nocturnal work and faulty diet. Marx was fond of highly seasoned dishes, smoked fish, caviare, pickled cucumbers, "none of which are good for liver patients", but he also liked wine and liqueurs and smoked an enormous amount "and since he had no money, it was usually bad-quality cigars". From 1863, Marx complained a lot about boils: "These are very frequent with liver patients and may be due to the same causes".<ref>Blumenberg, 100.</ref> The abscesses were so bad that Marx could neither sit nor work upright. According to Blumenberg, Marx's irritability is often found in liver patients:

<blockquote>The illness emphasised certain traits in his character. He argued cuttingly, his biting satire did not shrink at insults, and his expressions could be rude and cruel. Though in general Marx had a blind faith in his closest friends, nevertheless he himself complained that he was sometimes too mistrustful and unjust even to them. His verdicts, not only about enemies but even about friends, were sometimes so harsh that even less sensitive people would take offence… There must have been few whom he did not criticize like this… not even Engels was an exception.<ref>Blumenberg, 99-100.</ref></blockquote>

According to Princeton historian J.E. Seigel, in his late teens Marx may have had pneumonia or pleurisy, the effects of which led to his being exempted from Prussian military service. In later life whilst working on ''Capital'' (which he never completed),<ref>Blumenberg, 98; Siegel, 494.</ref> Marx suffered from a trio of afflictions. A liver ailment, probably hereditary, was aggravated by overwork, bad diet and lack of sleep. Inflammation of the eyes was induced by too much work at night. A third affliction, eruption of carbuncles or boils, "was probably brought on by general physical debility to which the various features of Marx's style of life — alcohol, tobacco, poor diet, and failure to sleep — all contributed. Engels often exhorted Marx to alter this dangerous regime". In Professor Siegel's thesis, what lay behind this punishing sacrifice of his health may have been guilt about self-involvement and egoism, originally induced in Karl Marx by his father.<ref>Seigel, 495-6.</ref>

In 2007, a [[retrodiagnosis]] of Marx's skin disease was made by [[dermatologist]] Sam Shuster of [[Newcastle University]] and for Shuster the most probable explanation was that Marx suffered not from liver problems, but from [[hidradenitis suppurativa]], a recurring infective condition arising from blockage of [[apocrine]] ducts opening into [[hair follicles]]. This condition, which was not described in the English medical literature until 1933 (hence would not have been known to Marx's physicians), can produce joint pain (which could be misdiagnosed as rheumatic disorder) and painful eye conditions. To arrive at his retrodiagnosis, Shuster considered the primary material: the Marx correspondence published in the 50 volumes of the ''Marx/Engels Collected Works''. There, "although the skin lesions were called 'furuncules', 'boils' and 'carbuncles' by Marx, his wife and his physicians, they were too persistent, recurrent, destructive and site-specific for that diagnosis". The sites of the persistent 'carbuncles' were noted repeatedly in the armpits, groins, [[perianal]], [[genital]] ([[Human penis|penis]] and [[scrotum]]) and [[suprapubic]] regions and inner thighs, "favoured sites of hidradenitis suppurativa". Professor Shuster claimed the diagnosis "can now be made definitively".<ref>Shuster, 1-2.</ref>

Shuster went on to consider the potential [[psychosocial]] effects of the disease, noting that the skin is an organ of communication and that hidradenitis suppurativa produces much psychological distress, including loathing and disgust and depression of self-image, mood and well-being, feelings for which Shuster found "much evidence" in the Marx correspondence. Professor Shuster went on to ask himself whether the mental effects of the disease affected Marx's work and even helped him to develop [[Marx's theory of alienation|his theory of alienation]].<ref>Shuster, 3.</ref>

===Death===
[[File:Grave of Karl Marx Highgate Cemetery in London 2016 (10).jpg|thumb|400px|Memorial to Karl Marx, East [[Highgate Cemetery]], London]]
Following the death of his wife Jenny in December 1881, Marx developed a [[catarrh]] that kept him in ill health for the last 15 months of his life. It eventually brought on the [[bronchitis]] and [[pleurisy]] that killed him in London on 14 March 1883 (age 64), dying a [[Statelessness|stateless person]].<ref name="stateless"/> Family and friends in London buried his body in [[Highgate Cemetery]] (East), Highgate, London on 17 March 1883 in an area reserved for agnostics and atheists ([[George Eliot]]'s grave is nearby). There were between nine and eleven mourners at his funeral.<ref>[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=3KOyuSakn80C&pg=PA382 p. 382].</ref><ref name="GouldMcGarr2007"/>

Several of his closest friends spoke at his funeral, including [[Wilhelm Liebknecht]] and Friedrich Engels. Engels' speech included the passage: {{quote|On the 14th&nbsp;of March, at a quarter to three in the afternoon, the greatest living thinker ceased to think. He had been left alone for scarcely two minutes, and when we came back we found him in his armchair, peacefully gone to sleep—but forever.<ref name="1883: The death of Karl Marx"/>}}

Marx's surviving daughters [[Eleanor Marx|Eleanor]] and [[Laura Marx|Laura]], as well as [[Charles Longuet]] and [[Paul Lafargue]], Marx's two French socialist sons-in-law, were also in attendance.<ref name="GouldMcGarr2007"/> He had been predeceased by his wife and his eldest daughter, the latter dying a few months earlier in January 1883. Liebknecht, a founder and leader of the German Social Democratic Party, gave a speech in German and Longuet, a prominent figure in the French working-class movement, made a short statement in French.<ref name="GouldMcGarr2007"/> Two [[telegram]]s from workers' parties in France and Spain were also read out.<ref name="GouldMcGarr2007"/> Together with Engels's speech, this constituted the entire programme of the funeral.<ref name="GouldMcGarr2007"/> Non-relatives attending the funeral included three communist associates of Marx: Friedrich Lessner, imprisoned for three years after the Cologne communist trial of 1852; G. Lochner, whom Engels described as "an old member of the Communist League"; and [[Carl Schorlemmer]], a professor of chemistry in Manchester, a member of the [[Royal Society]] and a communist activist involved in the 1848 [[Revolution in Baden|Baden revolution]].<ref name="GouldMcGarr2007"/> Another attendee of the funeral was [[Ray Lankester]], a British zoologist who would later become a prominent academic.<ref name="GouldMcGarr2007"/>

Upon his own death in 1895, Engels left Marx's two surviving daughters a "significant portion" of his $4.8 million estate.<ref name=Montefiore />

Marx and his family were reburied on a new site nearby in November 1954. The memorial at the new site, unveiled on 14 March 1956,<ref>{{cite web|title=The posthumous life of Karl Marx, Highgate Cemetery|url=http://thelondondead.blogspot.co.uk/2014/07/the-posthumous-life-of-karl-marx.html|work=The London Dead|date=7 July 2014|accessdate=14 July 2015}}</ref> bears the carved message: "[[Workers of the world, unite!|WORKERS OF ALL LANDS UNITE]]", the final line of ''The Communist Manifesto;'' and from the 11th "[[Theses on Feuerbach|Thesis on Feuerbach]]" (edited by Engels): "The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways—the point however is to change it".<ref name="wh1" /> The [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] had the monument with a portrait bust by [[Laurence Bradshaw]] erected and Marx's original tomb had only humble adornment.<ref name="wh1"/> In 1970, there was an unsuccessful attempt to destroy the monument using a homemade bomb.<ref>[http://www.camdennewjournal.co.uk/111705/cn111705_11.htm "Tomb raiders' failed attack on Marx grave"], ''Camden New Journal''</ref>

The late Marxist historian [[Eric Hobsbawm]] remarked: "One cannot say Marx died a failure" because although he had not achieved a large following of disciples in Britain, his writings had already begun to make an impact on the leftist movements in Germany and Russia. Within 25 years of his death, the continental European socialist parties that acknowledged Marx's influence on their politics were each gaining between 15 and 47 per cent in those countries with [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] elections.<ref>[[#Hob11|Hobsbawm 2011]]. pp. 03–04.</ref>

==Thought==
{{Marxism}}

===Influences===
{{Main article|Influences on Karl Marx}}
Marx's thought demonstrates influences from many thinkers including, but not limited to:
* [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus']] philosophy, including the forceful and equal redistribution of resources (land) and the equality of all citizens<ref>[[Plutarch]], [http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/lycurgus.html Biography of Lycurgus]</ref><ref>[[Xenophon]],[https://stacitiesbaad.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/xenophon-spartan-society.doc Spartan Society]</ref>
* [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s philosophy<ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/>
* the classical [[political economy]] (economics) of [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Ricardo]]<ref name="Sherman1995"/>
* [[History of the Left in France|French socialist thought]],<ref name="Sherman1995"/> in particular the thought of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and [[Charles Fourier]]<ref name="Beilharz1992"/><ref name="Clark1998"/>
* earlier German philosophical materialism among the [[Young Hegelians]], particularly that of [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] and [[Bruno Bauer]],<ref name=et/> as well as the French materialism of the late 18th Century, including [[Diderot]], [[Claude Adrien Helvétius]] and [[d'Holbach]]
* the working class analysis by [[Friedrich Engels]],<ref name="Bottomore1991"/> as well as the early descriptions of class provided by French liberals and Saint-Simonians such as [[François Guizot]] and [[Augustin Thierry]]
* Marx’s Judaic legacy has been identified as formative to both his moral outlook<ref>Eaglelton, Terry ''Why Marx Was Right''  Yale University Press, 2011, p. 158</ref> and his materialist philosophy.<ref>Seigel, Jerrold  ''Marx's Fate'' Princeton University Press, 1978, pp.  112-19</ref>  

Marx's view of history, which came to be called [[historical materialism]] (controversially adapted as the philosophy of [[dialectical materialism]] by Engels and Lenin), certainly shows the influence of Hegel's claim that one should view reality (and history) [[dialectic]]ally.<ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/> However, Hegel had thought in [[idealist]] terms, putting ideas in the forefront, whereas Marx sought to rewrite dialectics in [[materialist]] terms, arguing for the primacy of matter over idea.<ref name=sep/><ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/> Where Hegel saw the "spirit" as driving history, Marx saw this as an unnecessary mystification, obscuring the reality of humanity and its physical actions shaping the world.<ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/> He wrote that Hegelianism stood the movement of reality on its head, and that one needed to set it upon its feet.<ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/> Despite his dislike of mystical terms, Marx used [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] language in several of his works and in ''The Capital'' he refers to capital as "[[necromancy]] that surrounds the products of labour".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/OPE/archive/0604/att-0138/01-PoliticalEconOfTheDead.pdf|author=Mark Neocleous|title=THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF THE DEAD: MARX's VAMPIRES}}</ref>

Though inspired by French socialist and sociological thought,<ref name="Sherman1995"/> Marx criticised [[utopian socialists]], arguing that their favoured small-scale socialistic communities would be bound to marginalisation and poverty and that only a large-scale change in the [[economic system]] can bring about real change.<ref name="Clark1998"/>

The other important contribution to Marx's revision of Hegelianism came from Engels's book, ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'', which led Marx to conceive of the historical dialectic in terms of [[class conflict]] and to see the modern working class as the most progressive force for revolution.<ref name="Bottomore1991"/>

Marx believed that he could study history and society scientifically and discern tendencies of history and the resulting outcome of social conflicts. Some followers of Marx therefore concluded that a communist revolution would inevitably occur. However, Marx famously asserted in the eleventh of his "[[Theses on Feuerbach]]" that "philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point however is to change it" and he clearly dedicated himself to trying to alter the world.<ref name="Calhoun2002-23-24"/><ref name="wh1" />

===Philosophy and social thought===
Marx's polemic with other thinkers often occurred through [[critique]] and thus he has been called "the first great user of [[critical method]] in social sciences".<ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/><ref name="Sherman1995"/> He criticised speculative philosophy, equating [[metaphysics]] with ideology.<ref name="Bannerji2001"/> By adopting this approach, Marx attempted to separate key findings from ideological biases.<ref name="Sherman1995"/> This set him apart from many contemporary philosophers.<ref name="Calhoun2002-23-24"/>

Marx had a special concern with how people relate to their own labour power.<ref name="Calhoun2002-22"/> He wrote extensively about this in terms of the problem of [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]].<ref name="Mészáros2006"/> As with the dialectic, Marx began with a Hegelian notion of alienation but developed a more materialist conception.<ref name="Calhoun2002-22"/> Capitalism mediates social relationships of production (such as among workers or between workers and capitalists) through commodities, including labour, that are bought and sold on the market.<ref name="Calhoun2002-22"/> For Marx, the possibility that one may give up ownership of one's own labour—one's capacity to transform the world—is tantamount to being alienated from one's own nature and it is a spiritual loss.<ref name="Calhoun2002-22"/> Marx described this loss as [[commodity fetishism]], in which the things that people produce, commodities, appear to have a life and movement of their own to which humans and their behaviour merely adapt.<ref name="Balibar1995"/>

Commodity fetishism provides an example of what Engels called "[[false consciousness]]",<ref name="KołakowskiFalla2005">{{cite book |author1=Leszek Kołakowski|author2=Paul Stephen Falla|title=Main currents of Marxism: the founders, the golden age, the breakdown|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qUCxpznbkaoC&pg=PA226|accessdate=8 March 2011|date=29 October 2005|publisher=W. W. Norton & Company|isbn=978-0-393-06054-6|page=226}}</ref> which relates closely to the understanding of ideology. By "ideology", Marx and Engels meant ideas that reflect the interests of a particular class at a particular time in history, but which contemporaries see as universal and eternal.<ref name="Hernadi1989"/> Marx and Engels's point was not only that such beliefs are at best half-truths, as they serve an important political function. Put another way, the control that one class exercises over the means of production includes not only the production of food or manufactured goods and it includes the production of ideas as well (this provides one possible explanation for why members of a subordinate class may hold ideas contrary to their own interests).<ref name=sep/><ref name="Thompson1990"/> An example of this sort of analysis is Marx's understanding of religion, summed up in a passage from the preface<ref>Karl Marx: [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1843/critique-hpr/intro.htm Introduction] to A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right, in: ''[[Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher]]'', February 1844</ref> to his 1843 ''Contribution to the [[Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right]]'': {{quote|Religious suffering is, at one and the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people. The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness. To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions.<ref name="MarxO'Malley1977"/>|sign=|source=}}

Whereas his [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] senior thesis at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Friedrich-Wilhelm-Gymnasium (Trier)|de|3=Friedrich-Wilhelm-Gymnasium (Trier)|lt=Gymnasium zu Trier}} argued that religion had as its primary social aim the promotion of [[solidarity (sociology)|solidarity]], here Marx sees the social function of religion in terms of highlighting/preserving political and economic ''status quo'' and [[Economic inequality|inequality]].<ref name="SwatosKivisto1998"/>

====Economy, history and society====
{{further information|Marxian economics}}
Marx's thoughts on labour were related to the primacy he gave to the economic relation in determining the society's past, present and future (see also [[economic determinism]]).<ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/><ref name="Clark1998"/><ref name="Turner2005"/> [[Accumulation of capital]] shapes the [[social system]].<ref name="Clark1998"/> For Marx, [[social change]] was about conflict between opposing interests, driven in the background by economic forces.<ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/> This became the inspiration for the body of works known as the [[conflict theory]].<ref name="Turner2005"/> In his [[sociocultural evolution|evolutionary]] model of history, he argued that [[human history]] began with free, productive and creative work that was over time coerced and dehumanised, a trend most apparent under capitalism.<ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/> Marx noted that this was not an intentional process, rather no individual or even state can go against the forces of economy.<ref name="Clark1998"/>

The organisation of society depends on [[means of production]]. Literally, those things, like land, natural resources and technology, necessary for the production of material goods and the [[relations of production]]. In other words, the social relationships people enter into as they acquire and use the means of production.<ref name="Turner2005"/> Together, these compose the [[mode of production]] and Marx distinguished historical eras in terms of distinct modes of production. Marx differentiated between [[base and superstructure]], with the base (or substructure) referring to the economic system and superstructure, to the cultural and political system.<ref name="Turner2005"/> Marx regarded this mismatch between (economic) base and (social) [[base and superstructure|superstructure]] as a major source of social disruption and conflict.<ref name="Turner2005"/>

Despite Marx's stress on critique of capitalism and discussion of the new [[communist society]] that should replace it, his explicit critique of capitalism is guarded, as he saw it as an improved society compared to the past ones ([[slavery]] and [[feudal]]).<ref name=sep/> Marx also never clearly discusses issues of [[morality]] and [[justice]], although scholars agree that his work contained [[Logical implication|implicit]] discussion of those concepts.<ref name=sep/>

[[File:Marx Moscow.jpg|thumb|Memorial to Karl Marx in Moscow, whose inscription reads: "[[Workers of the world, unite!|Proletarians of all countries, unite!]]"]]
Marx's view of capitalism was two-sided.<ref name=sep/><ref name="Wood1993"/> On one hand, in the 19th century's deepest critique of the dehumanising aspects of this system he noted that defining features of capitalism include alienation, exploitation and recurring, cyclical [[economic depressions|depressions]] leading to mass unemployment, while on the other hand capitalism is also characterised by "revolutionising, industrialising and universalising qualities of development, growth and progressivity" (by which Marx meant industrialisation, urbanisation, [[technological progress]], increased [[productivity]] and growth, [[rationality]] and [[scientific revolution]]) that are responsible for progress.<ref name=sep/><ref name="Wood1993"/><ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/> Marx considered the capitalist class to be one of the most revolutionary in history because it constantly improved the means of production, more so than any other class in history and was responsible for the overthrow of [[feudalism]] and its transition to capitalism.<ref name="Clark1998"/><ref name="Gilbert2010"/> Capitalism can stimulate considerable growth because the capitalist can and has an incentive to reinvest profits in new technologies and [[capital equipment]].<ref name="Calhoun2002-22"/>

According to Marx, capitalists take advantage of the difference between the labour market and the market for whatever commodity the capitalist can produce. Marx observed that in practically every successful industry, input unit-costs are lower than output unit-prices. Marx called the difference "[[surplus value]]" and argued that this surplus value had its source in [[surplus labour]], the difference between what it costs to keep workers alive and what they can produce.<ref name=sep/> Marx's dual view of capitalism can be seen in his description of the capitalists: he refers to them as [[vampire]]s sucking worker's blood, but at the same time<ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/> he notes that drawing profit is "by no means an injustice"<ref name=sep/> and that capitalists simply cannot go against the system.<ref name="Clark1998"/> The true problem lies with the "cancerous cell" of [[Capital (economics)|capital]], understood not as property or equipment, but the relations between workers and owners—the economic system in general.<ref name="Clark1998"/>

At the same time, Marx stressed that capitalism was unstable and prone to [[crisis theory|periodic crises]].<ref name=wk/> He suggested that over time capitalists would invest more and more in new technologies and less and less in labour.<ref name=sep/> Since Marx believed that surplus value appropriated from labour is the source of profits, he concluded that the rate of profit would fall even as the economy grew.<ref name="Calhoun2002-23"/> Marx believed that increasingly severe crises would punctuate this [[business cycles|cycle]] of growth, collapse and more growth.<ref name="Calhoun2002-23"/> Moreover, he believed that in the long-term, this process would necessarily enrich and [[empowerment|empower]] the capitalist class and impoverish the proletariat.<ref name="Calhoun2002-23"/><ref name="Clark1998"/> In section one of ''The Communist Manifesto'', Marx describes [[feudalism]], capitalism and the role internal social contradictions play in the historical process:
{{quote|We see then: the means of production and of exchange, on whose foundation the bourgeoisie built itself up, were generated in feudal society. At a certain stage in the development of these means of production and of exchange, the conditions under which feudal society produced and exchanged&nbsp;... the feudal relations of property became no longer compatible with the already developed productive forces; they became so many fetters. They had to be burst asunder; they were burst asunder. Into their place stepped free competition, accompanied by a social and political constitution adapted in it, and the economic and political sway of the bourgeois class. A similar movement is going on before our own eyes&nbsp;... The productive forces at the disposal of society no longer tend to further the development of the conditions of bourgeois property; on the contrary, they have become too powerful for these conditions, by which they are fettered, and so soon as they overcome these fetters, they bring order into the whole of bourgeois society, endanger the existence of bourgeois property.<ref name=manifesto/>}}

[[File:MandK Industrial Revolution 1900.jpg|thumb|Marx believed that industrial workers (the [[proletariat]]) would rise up around the world]]
Marx believed that those structural contradictions within capitalism necessitate its end, giving way to socialism, or a post-capitalistic, communist society:
{{quote|The development of Modern Industry, therefore, cuts from under its feet the very foundation on which the bourgeoisie produces and appropriates products. What the bourgeoisie, therefore, produces, above all, are its own grave-diggers. Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable.<ref name="manifesto"/>|sign=|source=}}

Thanks to various processes overseen by capitalism, such as urbanisation, the working class, the proletariat, should grow in numbers and develop [[class consciousness]], in time realising that they have to and can change the system.<ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/><ref name="Clark1998"/> Marx believed that if the proletariat were to seize the means of production, they would encourage social relations that would benefit everyone equally, abolishing exploiting class and introduce a system of production less vulnerable to cyclical crises.<ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/> Marx argued in ''[[The German Ideology]]'' that capitalism will end through the organised actions of an international working class: {{quote|Communism is for us not a state of affairs which is to be established, an ideal to which reality will have to adjust itself. We call communism the real movement which abolishes the present state of things. The conditions of this movement result from the premises now in existence.<ref name="Elster1985"/>|sign=|source=}}

In this new society, the self-alienation would end and humans would be free to act without being bound by the labour market.<ref name="Calhoun2002-23"/> It would be a democratic society, enfranchising the entire population.<ref name="Clark1998"/> In such a [[utopia]]n world there would also be little if any need for a state, which goal was to enforce the alienation.<ref name="Calhoun2002-23"/> He theorised that between capitalism and the establishment of a socialist/communist system, a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]—a period where the working class holds political power and forcibly socialises the means of production—would exist.<ref name="Clark1998"/> As he wrote in his ''[[Critique of the Gotha Program]]'', "between capitalist and communist society there lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other. Corresponding to this is also a political transition period in which the state can be nothing but the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat".<ref name="Karl Marx:Critique of the Gotha Programme"/> While he allowed for the possibility of peaceful transition in some countries with strong democratic institutional structures (such as Britain, the United States and the Netherlands), he suggested that in other countries in what workers can not "attain their goal by peaceful means" the "lever of our revolution must be force".<ref>"You know that the institutions, mores, and traditions of various countries must be taken into consideration, and we do not deny that there are countries – such as America, England, and if I were more familiar with your institutions, I would perhaps also add Holland – where the workers can attain their goal by peaceful means. This being the case, we must also recognise the fact that in most countries on the Continent the lever of our revolution must be force; it is force to which we must some day appeal to erect the rule of labour."

''[[The Observer]]''.</ref><ref name="Allan2010"/> Followers of Marx have frequently debated amongst themselves over how to interpret Marx's writings and apply his concepts to the modern world.<ref name="AndersenKaspersen2000"/> The legacy of Marx's thought has become contested between numerous tendencies, each of which sees itself as Marx's most accurate interpreter. In the political realm, these tendencies include [[Leninism]], [[Marxism–Leninism]], [[Trotskyism]], [[Maoism]], [[Luxemburgism]] and [[libertarian Marxism]].<ref name="AndersenKaspersen2000"/> Various currents have also developed in [[Marxism#Academic Marxism|academic Marxism]], often under influence of other views, resulting in [[structuralist Marxism]], historical Marxism, phenomenological Marxism, [[analytical Marxism]] and Hegelian Marxism.<ref name="AndersenKaspersen2000"/>

From an academic perspective, Marx's work contributed to the birth of modern sociology. He has been cited as one of the nineteenth century's three masters of the "school of suspicion" alongside [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]<ref>Ricoeur, Paul. ''Freud and Philosophy: An Essay on Interpretation''. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1970, p. 32</ref> and as one of the three principal architects of modern [[social science]] along with [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[Max Weber]].<ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/> In contrast to other philosophers, Marx offered theories that could often be tested with the [[scientific method]].<ref name="Calhoun2002-23-24"/> Both Marx and [[Auguste Comte]] set out to develop scientifically justified ideologies in the wake of European [[secularisation]] and new developments in the [[philosophy of history|philosophies of history]] and science. Working in the Hegelian tradition, Marx rejected Comtean [[sociological positivism]] in attempt to develop a ''science of society''.<ref name="Calhoun2002-19"/> [[Karl Löwith]] considered Marx and [[Søren Kierkegaard]] to be the two greatest Hegelian philosophical successors.<ref>Löwith, Karl. ''From Hegel to Nietzsche''. New York: Columbia University Press, 1991, p. 49.</ref> In modern [[sociological theory]], [[Marxist sociology]] is recognised as one of the main classical perspectives.

In social theory, twentieth- and twenty-first-century, thinkers have pursued two main strategies in response to Marx. One move has been to reduce it to its analytical core, known as analytical Marxism. Another, more common move has been to dilute the explanatory claims of Marx's social theory and to emphasise the "relative autonomy" of aspects of social and economic life not directly related to Marx's central narrative of interaction between the development of the "forces of production" and the succession of "modes of production". Such has been for example the neo-marxist theorising adopted by historians inspired by Marx's social theory, such as [[E. P. Thompson]] and [[Eric Hobsbawm]]. It has also been a line of thinking pursued by thinkers and activists like [[Antonio Gramsci]] who have sought to understand the opportunities and the difficulties of transformative political practice, seen in the light of Marxist social theory.<ref>Kołakowski, Leszek.

Politically, Marx's legacy is more complex. Throughout the twentieth century, revolutions in dozens of countries labelled themselves "Marxist", most notably the [[Russian Revolution]], which led to the founding of the [[Soviet Union]].<ref name="April Thesis">{{cite web|last1=Lenin|first1=VI|title=The Tasks of the Proletariat in the Present Revolution|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/apr/04.htm|accessdate=8 January 2015}}</ref> Major world leaders including [[Vladimir Lenin]],<ref name="April Thesis" /> [[Mao Zedong]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Glossary of People - Ma|url=https://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/m/a.htm|publisher=Marxists.org|accessdate=8 January 2015}}</ref> [[Fidel Castro]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Savioli|first1=Arminio|title=L'Unita Interview with Fidel Castro:  The Nature of Cuban Socialism|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/cuba/archive/castro/1961/02/01.htm|publisher=Marxists|accessdate=8 January 2015}}</ref> [[Salvador Allende]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Allende|first1=Salvador|title=First speech to the Chilean parliament after his election|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/allende/1970/september/20.htm|publisher=Marxists.org|accessdate=8 January 2015}}</ref> [[Josip Broz Tito]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tito|first1=Josef|title=Historical Development in the World Will Move Towards the Strengthening of Socialism|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/tito/1959/04/19.htm|publisher=Marxists.org|accessdate=8 January 2015}}</ref> [[Kwame Nkrumah]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nkrumah|first1=Kwame|title=African Socialism Revisited|url=https://www.marxists.org/subject/africa/nkrumah/1967/african-socialism-revisited.htm|publisher=Marxists.org|accessdate=8 January 2015}}</ref> and [[Thomas Sankara]] all cited Marx as an influence and his ideas informed political parties worldwide beyond those where Marxist revolutions took place.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jeffries|first1=Stuart|title=Why Marxism is on the rise again|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/04/the-return-of-marxism|work=The Guardian|accessdate=8 January 2015}}</ref> The countries associated with some Marxist nations have led political opponents to blame Marx for millions of deaths,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stanley|first1=Tim|title=The Left is trying to rehabilitate Karl Marx.
