''Arguing About Justice: Essays for Philippe Van Parijs'' (Axel Gosseries & Yannick Vanderborght eds., Presses universitaires de Louvain, 2012) was published on the occasion of his 60th birthday.

== Work ==
In ''Real Freedom for All: What (if anything) can justify capitalism?''<ref>Philippe Van Parijs, Real Freedom for All, What (if anything) can justify capitalism: Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1995</ref> (1995) he argues for both the justice and feasibility of a [[basic income]] for every citizen. Van Parijs asserts that it promotes the achievement of a [[real freedom]] to make choices. For example, he purports that one cannot really choose to stay at home to raise children or start a business if one cannot afford to. As proposed by Van Parijs, such freedom should be feasible through taxing the scarce, valued social good of jobs, as a form of [[income redistribution]].

Another part of Van Parijs' work is about linguistic justice. In order to address the injustice arising from the privilege enjoyed by English as a global lingua franca, he discusses a wide range of measures such as a [[language tax]]<ref>Philippe Van Parijs, [http://www.uclouvain.be/cps/ucl/doc/etes/documents/DOCH_122_%28PVP%29.pdf Europe's three language problems], Multilingualism in Law and Politics</ref> which would be paid by English-speaking countries, a ban on the dubbing of films, and the enforcement of a linguistic territoriality principle that would protect weaker languages.<ref>Philippe Van Parijs, [http://global.oup.com/academic/product/linguistic-justice-for-europe-and-for-the-world-9780199208876 Linguistic Justice for Europe and for the World], Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011.</ref>

Van Parijs's work is sometimes associated with the [[September Group]] of [[analytic Marxism]], though he is not himself a Marxist.
