'''Howard Jerome Keisler''' (born 3 December 1936) is an American [[mathematician]], currently professor emeritus at [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. His research has included [[model theory]] and [[non-standard analysis]].

His Ph.D. advisor was [[Alfred Tarski]] at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]]; his dissertation is ''Ultraproducts and Elementary Classes'' (1961).

Following [[Abraham Robinson]]'s work resolving what had long been thought to be inherent logical contradictions in the literal interpretation of [[Leibniz's notation]] that Leibniz himself had proposed, that is, interpreting "dx" as literally representing an [[infinitesimal]]ly small quantity, Keisler published ''[[Elementary Calculus: An Infinitesimal Approach]]'', a first-year calculus textbook conceptually centered on the use of infinitesimals, rather than the [[epsilon, delta approach]], for developing the calculus.

He is also known for extending the [[Henkin construction]] (of [[Leon Henkin]]) to what are now called [[Henkin–Keisler model]]s.<ref>{{springer|id=h/h110150|title=Henkin construction|author=G. Weaver}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=George Weaver|title=Henkin-Keisler models|year=1997|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-7923-4366-0}}</ref>

He held the named chair of [[Vilas Professor of Mathematics]] at Wisconsin.

Among Keisler's graduate students, several have made notable mathematical contributions, including [[Frederick Rowbottom]] who discovered [[Rowbottom cardinal]]s.  Several others have gone on to careers in computer science research and product development, including: Michael Benedikt, a professor of computer science at the [[University of Oxford]], [[Kevin J. Compton]], a professor of computer science at the [[University of Michigan]], Curtis Tuckey, a developer of software-based collaboration environments; [[Joseph Sgro]], a neurologist and developer of [[vision processor]] hardware and software, and [[Edward L. Wimmers]], a database researcher at [[IBM Almaden Research Center]].

In 2012 he became a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].<ref>[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2013-01-27.</ref>

His son Jeffrey Keisler is a [[Fulbright]] Distinguished Chair.<ref>https://www.umb.edu/news/detail/keisler_first_umass_boston_prof_to_be_named_distinguished_fulbright_chair</ref>
