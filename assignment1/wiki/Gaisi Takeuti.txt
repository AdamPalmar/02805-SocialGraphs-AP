{{nihongo|'''Gaisi Takeuti'''|竹内 外史|Takeuchi Gaishi|extra=January 25, 1926 – May 10, 2017<ref>[https://list.math.cas.cz/pipermail/proof-complexity/2017-May/000206.html]</ref>}} was a [[Japan]]ese [[mathematician]], known for his work in [[proof theory]].<ref>{{harvnb|Takeuti|2013}}.</ref>

After graduating from [[Tokyo University]], he went to [[Princeton University|Princeton]] to study under [[Kurt Gödel]]. 
<!-- Cite? He was one of the few people that Godel could feel comfortable with. --> 
He later became a professor at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]. Takeuti was president (2003–2009) of the [[Kurt Gödel Society]], having worked on the respected book ''Memoirs of a Proof Theorist: Godel and Other Logicians''.  His goal was to prove the consistency of the real numbers.  To this end, [[Takeuti conjecture|Takeuti's conjecture]] speculates that a [[sequent calculus|sequent]] formalisation of [[second-order logic]] has [[cut-elimination theorem|cut-elimination]].<ref>{{harvnb|Takeuti|1953}}. An erratum to this article was published in the same journal (24:149–156, 1954).</ref>  He is also known for his work on [[ordinal notation|ordinal diagrams]] with Akiko Kino.
