'''Cora Diamond''' (born 1937)<ref>[http://d-nb.info/gnd/1025941004/about/html DNB]</ref> is an [[American philosopher]] who works on [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Gottlob Frege]], [[moral philosophy]], [[political philosophy]], [[philosophy of language]], and philosophy and literature. She is currently the Kenan Professor of Philosophy Emerita at the [[University of Virginia]].

==Work==
One of Diamond's most famous articles, ''What Nonsense Might Be'', criticizes the way that the [[logical positivism|logical positivists]] think about nonsense on [[Gottlob Frege|Fregean]] grounds (See [[category mistake]]). Another well-known article, ''Eating Meat and Eating People'', examines the rhetorical and philosophical nature of contemporary attitudes towards [[animal rights]]. Diamond's writings on both "early" (''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' era) and "late" (''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' era) Wittgenstein have made her a leading influence in the [[New Wittgenstein|New Wittgenstinian]] approach advanced by [[Alice Crary]], [[James F. Conant]], and others.

Diamond has published a collection of essays titled ''The Realistic Spirit: Wittgenstein, Philosophy, and the Mind.'' She is the editor of ''Wittgenstein's Lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics: Cambridge 1939,'' a collection of lectures assembled from the notes of Wittgenstein's students [[Norman Malcolm]], [[Rush Rhees]], [[Yorick Smythies]], and R.G. Bosanquet.

''Wittgenstein and the Moral Life: Essays in Honor of Cora Diamond'' (edited by [[Alice Crary]]<ref>http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/wittgenstein-and-moral-life</ref>) features essays by [[Alice Crary|Crary]], [[John McDowell]], [[Martha Nussbaum]], [[Stanley Cavell]], and [[James F. Conant]], among others.

Diamond received her [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] from [[Swarthmore College]] in 1957 and her [[Bachelor of Philosophy|BPhil]] from [[St Hugh's College, Oxford]] in 1961.
