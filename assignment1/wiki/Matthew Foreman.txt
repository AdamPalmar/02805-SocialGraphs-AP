'''Matthew Dean Foreman''' (born March 21, 1957) is an American mathematician at
[[University of California, Irvine]]. He has made notable contributions in [[set theory]] and in [[ergodic theory]].

==Biography==

Born in [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]], Foreman earned his [[Ph.D.]] from the
University of California, Berkeley in 1980 under [[Robert M. Solovay]]. His
dissertation title was ''Large Cardinals and Strong Model Theoretic Transfer
Properties''.

In addition to his mathematical work, Foreman is an avid sailor. He and his family
sailed their sailboat  ''Veritas'' (a C&C 44 [[C&C Yachts]]) from North America to
Europe in 2000. From 2000&ndash;2008 they sailed Veritas to the Arctic, the Shetland
Islands, Scotland, Ireland, England, France, Spain, North Africa and Italy. Notable
high points were Fastnet Rock, Irish and Celtic seas and many passages including the
Maelstrom, Stad, Pentland Firth, Loch Ness, the Corryveckan and the Irish Sea.
Further south they sailed through the Chenal du Four and Raz de Sein, across the Bay
of Biscay and around Cape Finisterre.  After entering Gibraltar, Foreman and his
family circumnavigated the Western Mediterranean with notable stops in Barcelona,
Morocco, Tunisia, Sicily, Naples, Sardinia and Corsica. In 2009, Foreman and his son
and guest crew circumnavigated Newfoundland.<ref>Foreman, Zachary (2007) "Under
Way", Cruising World Magazine, October 2007</ref> Foreman has been recognized for
his sailing by twice winning the Ullman Trophy.<ref>Tailwind, [[Balboa Yacht Club]]

==Work==
Foreman began his career in set theory. His early work with [[W. Hugh Woodin|Hugh Woodin]] included showing that it is consistent that the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis (GCH) (see [[continuum hypothesis]]) fails at every infinite cardinal.<ref>Foreman, M.; Woodin, W. Hugh: The generalized continuum hypothesis can fail everywhere, ''Ann. of Math.'', (2) '''133'''(1991), no. 1, 1&ndash;35</ref> In joint work with [[Menachem Magidor|Magidor]] and [[Saharon Shelah|Shelah]] he formulated [[Martin's maximum]], a provably maximal form of [[Martin's axiom]] and showed its consistency. <ref>Foreman, M.; Magidor, M.; Shelah, S.: Martin's maximum, saturated ideals, and nonregular ultrafilters. I, ''[[Annals of Mathematics|Ann. of Math.]]'' (2), '''127'''(1988), no. 1, 1&ndash;47</ref> <ref>Foreman, M.; Magidor, M.; Shelah, S: Martin's maximum, saturated ideals and nonregular ultrafilters. II, ''Ann. of Math.'', (2), '''127'''(1988), no. 3, 521&ndash;545.</ref> Foreman's later work in set theory was primarily concerned with developing the consequences of generic large cardinal axioms.<ref>Foreman, M.; Ideals and generic elementary embeddings. Handbook of Set Theory, Vol 2, pp. 885-1147, Springer, 2010. </ref> He also worked on classical "Hungarian" [[Infinitary combinatorics|partition relations]], mostly with [[András Hajnal]].<ref>Foreman, M; Hajnal, A.: A partition relation for successors of large cardinals, ''[[Mathematische Annalen|Math. Ann.]]'', '''325'''(2003), no. 3, 583–623.</ref>

In the late 1980s Foreman became interested in [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] theory and [[ergodic theory]]. With [[Randall Dougherty]] he settled the Marczewski problem (1930) by showing that there is a Banach–Tarski decomposition of the unit ball in which all pieces have the property of Baire (see [[Banach–Tarski paradox]]).<ref>Dougherty, R; Foreman, M. Banach–Tarski decompositions using sets with the property of Baire. J. Amer. Math. Soc. 7 (1994), no. 1, 75–124</ref> A consequence is the existence of a decomposition of an open dense subset of the unit ball into disjoint open sets that can be rearranged by isometries to form two open dense subsets of the unit ball. With F. Wehrung, Foreman showed that the [[Hahn–Banach theorem]] implied the existence of a non-Lebesgue measurable set, even in the absence of any other form of the [[axiom of choice]].<ref>Foreman, M.; Wehrung, F. The Hahn–Banach theorem implies the existence of a non-Lebesgue measurable set. Fund. Math. 138 (1991), no. 1, 13–19.</ref>

This naturally led to attempts to apply the tools of [[descriptive set theory]] to classification problems in [[ergodic theory]]. His first work in this direction, with F. Beleznay,<ref>Beleznay, F.; Foreman, M. The collection of distal flows is not Borel. Amer. J. Math. 117 (1995), no. 1, 203–239.</ref> showed that classical collections were beyond the [[Borel hierarchy]] in complexity. This was followed shortly by a proof of the analogous results for measure preserving transformations with generalized discrete spectrum. In a collaboration with [[Benjamin Weiss]] <ref>Foreman, M.; [[Benjamin Weiss|Weiss, B.]]: An anti-classification theorem for ergodic measure preserving transformations, ''[[Journal of the European Mathematical Society|J. Eur. Math. Soc.]]'' (JEMS), '''6'''(2004), no. 3, 277&ndash;292.</ref> and Daniel Rudolph <ref>Foreman, M.; Rudolph, D. J.; [[Benjamin Weiss|Weiss, B.]] The conjugacy problem in ergodic theory. Ann. of Math. (2) 173 (2011), no. 3, 1529–1586.</ref> Foreman showed that no residual class of measure preserving transformations can have algebraic invariants and that the isomorphism relation on ergodic measure preserving transformations in not Borel. This negative result finished a program proposed by von Neumann in the 1932.<ref>von Neumann, J. Zur Operatorenmethode in der klassischen Mechanik. Ann. of Math. (2), 33(3):587–642, 1932</ref> This result was extended by Foreman and Weiss to show that smooth area preserving diffeomorphisms of the 2-torus are unclassifiable.

Foreman's work in set theory continued during this period. He co-edited (with [[Akihiro Kanamori|Kanamori]]) the ''Handbook of Set Theory''  and showed that various combinatorial properties of ω<sub>2</sub> and ω<sub>3</sub> are equiconsistent with [[huge cardinal]]s.<ref>Foreman, Matthew: [[Smoke and mirrors]]: combinatorial properties of small cardinals equiconsistent with huge cardinals, ''[[Advances in Mathematics|Adv. Math.]]'', '''222'''(2009), no. 2, 565&ndash;595.
