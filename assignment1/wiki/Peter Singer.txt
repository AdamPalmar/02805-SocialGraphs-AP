'''Peter Albert David Singer''', [[Order of Australia|AC]] (born 6 July 1946) is an Australian moral philosopher. He is the Ira W. DeCamp Professor of Bioethics at [[Princeton University]], and a Laureate Professor at the [[Centre for Applied Philosophy and Public Ethics]] at the [[University of Melbourne]]. He specializes in [[applied ethics]] and approaches ethical issues from a [[Secularity|secular]], [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] perspective. He is known in particular for his book ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'' (1975), in which he argues in favor of [[vegetarianism]], and his essay "[[Famine, Affluence, and Morality]]," in which he argues in favor of donating to help the global poor. For most of his career, he was a [[preference utilitarianism|preference utilitarian]], but he announced in ''The Point of View of the Universe (2014)'', coauthored with [[Katarzyna de Lazari-Radek]], that he had become a [[Utilitarianism#Higher and lower pleasures|hedonistic utilitarian]].

On two occasions, Singer served as chair of the philosophy department at [[Monash University]], where he founded its [[Centre for Human Bioethics]]. In 1996 he stood unsuccessfully as a [[Australian Greens|Greens]] candidate for the [[Australian Senate]]. In 2004 Singer was recognized as the Australian Humanist of the Year by the [[Council of Australian Humanist Societies]], and in 2006 he was voted one of Australia's ten most influential public intellectuals. Singer is a cofounder of [[Animals Australia]] and the founder of The Life You Can Save.

==Early life, education and career==
Singer's parents were [[History of the Jews in Austria|Austrian Jews]] who immigrated to Australia from [[Vienna]] in 1938, after [[Anschluss|Austria's annexation]] by [[Nazi Germany]].<ref name = talkingheads>{{cite web | last = Thompson | first = Peter | title = Talking Heads – Peter Singer | url = http://www.abc.net.au/talkingheads/txt/s1932378.htm | date = 28 May 2007 | accessdate = 24 October 2011}}</ref> They settled in [[Melbourne]], where Singer was born. Singer's father imported tea and coffee, while his mother practiced medicine. He has a sister, Joan (now Joan Dwyer).

His grandparents were less fortunate: his paternal grandparents were taken by the Germans Nazis to [[Ghetto Litzmannstadt|Łódź]], and were never heard from again; his maternal grandfather David Ernst Oppenheim (1881–1943), a teacher, died in the [[Theresienstadt concentration camp]].<ref>Aiton, Douglas: Ten Things You Didn't Know about Professor Peter Singer.

Singer attended [[Preshil]]<ref>Suzannah Pearce, ed. (17 November 2006). "RICHARDSON (Sue) Susan." ''Who's Who in Australia Live!'' North Melbourne, Vic: Crown Content Pty Ltd.</ref> and later [[Scotch College, Melbourne|Scotch College]]. After leaving school, Singer studied [[law]], [[history]], and [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Melbourne]], gaining his [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] degree ([[hons]]) in 1967.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/feb/15/peter-singer-profile | last = Vulliamy | first = Ed | date = 15 February 2009 | accessdate = 24 October 2011 | title = Peter Singer: Moral arbiter of life and death | location=London | work=The Guardian}}</ref> Subsequently, he received an [[Master of Arts|MA]] degree for a thesis entitled "Why should I be moral?" at the same university in 1969. He was awarded a scholarship to study at the [[University of Oxford]], and obtained from there a [[Bachelor of Philosophy|BPhil]] degree in 1971, with a thesis on civil disobedience supervised by [[R.

==Applied ethics==
{{Utilitarianism}}
Singer's ''[[Practical Ethics]]'' (1979) analyzes why and how living beings' interests should be weighed. His principle of equal consideration of interests does not dictate equal treatment of all those with interests, since different interests warrant different treatment. All have an interest in avoiding pain, for instance, but relatively few have an interest in cultivating their abilities. Not only does his principle justify different treatment for different interests, but it allows different treatment for the same interest when [[marginal utility|diminishing marginal utility]] is a factor. For example, this approach would privilege a starving person's interest in food over the same interest of someone who is only slightly hungry.

Among the more important human interests are those in avoiding pain, in developing one's abilities, in satisfying basic needs for food and shelter, in enjoying warm personal relationships, in being free to pursue one's projects without interference, "and many others". The fundamental interest that entitles a being to equal consideration is the capacity for "suffering and/or enjoyment or happiness". Singer holds that a being's interests should always be weighed according to that being's concrete properties. He favors a 'journey' model of life, which measures the wrongness of taking a life by the degree to which doing so frustrates a life journey's goals.{{clarify|date=October 2012}} The journey model is tolerant of some frustrated desire and explains why persons who have embarked on their journeys are not replaceable. Only a personal interest in continuing to live brings the journey model into play. This model also explains the priority that Singer attaches to ''interests'' over trivial desires and pleasures.

Ethical conduct is justified by reasons that go beyond prudence to "something bigger than the individual," addressing a larger audience. Singer thinks this going-beyond identifies moral reasons as "somehow universal", specifically in the injunction to 'love thy neighbor as thyself', interpreted by him as demanding that one give the same weight to the interests of others as one gives to one's own interests. This universalising step, which Singer traces from [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] to Hare,<ref>''Practical Ethics'', p. 11</ref> is crucial and sets him apart from those moral theorists, from [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]] to [[David Gauthier]], who tie morality to prudence. Universalisation leads directly to utilitarianism, Singer argues, on the strength of the thought that one's own interests cannot count for more than the interests of others. Taking these into account, one must weigh them up and adopt the course of action that is most likely to maximise the interests of those affected; utilitarianism has been arrived at. Singer's universalising step applies to interests without reference to who has them, whereas a Kantian's applies to the judgments of rational agents (in Kant's kingdom of ends, or [[John Rawls|Rawls]]'s Original Position, etc.). Singer regards Kantian universalisation as unjust to animals.<ref>Animal Liberation, pp. 211, 256</ref> As for the Hobbesians, Singer attempts a response in the final chapter of ''Practical Ethics'', arguing that self-interested reasons support adoption of the moral point of view, such as 'the [[paradox of hedonism]]', which counsels that happiness is best found by not looking for it, and the need most people feel to relate to something larger than their own concerns.

===Effective altruism and world poverty===
{{main|Effective altruism}}

Singer's ideas have contributed to the rise of [[effective altruism]].<ref name="sep-impartiality">{{cite web|last1=Jollimore|first1=Troy|title=Impartiality|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/impartiality/|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=11 March 2017|date=6 February 2017}}</ref> He argues that people should not only try to reduce suffering, but reduce it in the most effective manner possible. While Singer has previously written at length about the moral imperative to reduce poverty and eliminate the suffering of nonhuman animals, particularly in the meat industry, he writes about how the effective altruism movement is doing these things more effectively in his 2015 book, ''[[The Most Good You Can Do]]''. He is a board member of Animal Charity Evaluators, a charity evaluator used by many members of the effective altruism community which recommends the most cost-effective animal advocacy charities and interventions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/about/meet-our-team/board-of-directors/ |title=Board of Directors |accessdate=2015-02-18}}</ref>

His own organisation, The Life You Can Save, also recommends a selection of charities deemed by charity evaluators such as [[GiveWell]] to be the most effective when it comes to helping those in extreme poverty. TLYC was founded after Singer released his 2009 [[The Life You Can Save|eponymous book]], in which he argues more generally in favour of giving to charities that help to end global poverty. In particular, he expands upon some of the arguments made in his 1972 essay "[[Famine, Affluence and Morality]]", in which he posits that citizens of rich nations are morally obligated to give at least some of their disposable income to charities that help the global poor. He supports this using the drowning child analogy, which states that most people would rescue a drowning child from a pond, even if it meant that their expensive clothes were ruined, so we clearly value a human life more than the value of our material possessions. As a result, we should take a significant portion of the money that we spend on our possessions and instead donate it to charity.<ref>Peter Singer, [http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/199704--.htm The Drowning Child and the Expanding Circle], ''The Internationalist'', 1997</ref><ref name="skelton-tlycs-review">{{cite web|last1=Skelton|first1=Anthony|title=Nobody can do everything, but everyone can do something|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books-and-media/nobody-can-do-everything-but-everyone-can-do-something/article1149821/|website=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=17 March 2017|language=en-ca}}</ref>

===Animal liberation and veganism===

Published in 1975, ''Animal Liberation''<ref>''Animal Liberation: A New Ethics for our Treatment of Animals'', New York: New York review/Random House, 1975, {{ISBN|0-394-40096-8}}; second edition, 1990, {{ISBN|0-940322-00-5}}.</ref> has been cited as a formative influence on leaders of the modern animal liberation movement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thankingthemonkey.com/about_karen_dawn.php |title=Karen Dawn's Biography |publisher=Thankingthemonkey.com |date= |accessdate=23 May 2011}}</ref> The central argument of the book is an expansion of the [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] concept that "the greatest good of the greatest number" is the only measure of good or ethical behaviour, and Singer believes that there is no reason not to apply this principle to other animals, arguing that the boundary between human and "animal" is completely arbitrary. There are far more differences, for instance, between a great ape and an oyster, for example, than between a human and a great ape, and yet the former two are lumped together as "animals", whereas we are considered "human" in a way that supposedly differentiates us from all other "animals."

He popularized the term "[[speciesism]]", which had been coined by English writer [[Richard D. Ryder]] to describe the practice of privileging humans over other animals, and therefore argues in favour of the equal consideration of interests of all sentient beings.<ref name=Waldau2001p5>Waldau, Paul (2001). ''The Specter of Speciesism: Buddhist and Christian Views of Animals''. Oxford University Press, pp. 5, 23–29.</ref> In ''Animal Liberation'', Singer argues in favour of veganism and against animal experimentation.

Singer describes himself as a flexible vegan. He writes, "That is, I'm vegan when it's not too difficult to be vegan, but I'm not rigid about this, if I'm traveling for example."<ref>{{Cite web|title = An AMA with Peter Singer, author of Animal Liberation, The Life You Can Save, Practical Ethics, and The Most Good You Can Do. • /r/IAmA|url = https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w9n40/an_ama_with_peter_singer_author_of_animal/|website = reddit|accessdate = 2015-12-22}}</ref>

In an article for the online publication [[Chinadialogue]], Singer called Western-style meat production cruel, unhealthy, and damaging to the ecosystem.<ref name="Singer">{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/326-The-ethics-of-eating|title=The ethics of eating|work=chinadialogue.net}}</ref> He rejected the idea that the method was necessary to meet the population's increasing demand, explaining that animals in [[factory farm]]s have to eat food grown explicitly for them, and they burn up most of the food's energy just to breathe and keep their bodies warm. In a 2015 [[The Guardian|''Guardian'']] article Singer drew attention to the welfare of fish, called them the "forgotten victims on our plates" and quotes an estimate according to which between 1 and 2,7 trillion individual fish are killed each year for human consumption.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2010/sep/14/fish-forgotten-victims|title=Fish: the forgotten victims on our plate|date=2010-09-14|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-06-14|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.fishcount.org.uk/published/standard/fishcountfullrptSR.pdf|title=Worse things happen at sea: the welfare of wild-caught fish|last=Mood|first=Alison|publisher=fishcount.org.uk|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>

Some chapters of ''Animal Liberation'' are dedicated to criticising testing on animals but, unlike groups such as [[PETA]], Singer is willing to accept such testing when there is a clear benefit for medicine.  In November 2006, Singer appeared on the BBC programme ''Monkeys, Rats and Me: Animal Testing'' and said that he felt that [[Tipu Aziz]]'s experiments on monkeys for research into treating Parkinson's disease could be justified.<ref>{{cite news |last=Mangan |first=Lucy |date=28 November 2006 |title= Last night's TV|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/nov/28/animalwelfare.television |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |access-date=10 December 2016 }}</ref>  Whereas Singer has continued since the publication of ''Animal Liberation'' to promote vegetarianism and veganism, he has been much less vocal in recent years on the subject of animal experimentation.

Singer has defended some of the actions of the [[Animal Liberation Front]], such as the stealing of footage from Dr. Thomas Gennarelli's laboratory in May 1984 (as shown in the documentary ''[[Unnecessary Fuss]]''), but he has condemned other actions such as the use of explosives by some animal-rights activists and sees the freeing of captive animals as largely futile when they are easily replaced.<ref>{{cite book |last=Singer |first=Peter |date=2011 |title=Practical Ethics, 3rd Edition |location=UK |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=274 |isbn=9781139496896 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Singer |first=Peter |date=2015 |title=Animal Liberation (preface in 2015 revised edition) |location=UK |publisher=Random House |page=xxix |isbn=9781473524422 }}</ref>

===Other views===

====Meta-ethical views====

In the past, Singer has not held that objective moral values exist, on the basis that reason could favour both egoism and equal consideration of interests. Singer himself adopted utilitarianism on the basis that people's preferences can be universalised, leading to a situation where one takes the "point of view of the universe" and "an impartial standpoint". But in the Second Edition of ''Practical Ethics'', he concedes that the question of why we should act morally "cannot be given an answer that will provide everyone with overwhelming reasons for acting morally".<ref>Peter Singer, ''Practical Ethics'', Second Edition, 1993, p.335</ref>

However, when co-authoring ''The Point of View of the Universe'' (2014), Singer shifted to the position that objective moral values do exist, and defends the 19th Century utilitarian philosopher Henry Sidgwick's view that objective morality can be derived from fundamental moral axioms that are knowable by reason. Additionally, he endorses Derek Parfit's view that there are object-given reasons for action.<ref>Lazari-Radek, K, Singer, P., ''The Point of View of the Universe: Sidgwick and Contemporary Ethics'', Oxford University Press, 2014, p.126</ref> Furthermore, Singer and de Lazari-Radek (the co-author of the book) argue that evolutionary debunking arguments can be used to demonstrate that it is more rational to take the impartial standpoint of "the point of view of the universe", as opposed to egoism—pursuing one's own self-interest—because the existence of egoism is more likely to be the product of evolution by natural selection, rather than because it is correct, whereas taking an impartial standpoint and equally considering the interests of all sentient beings is in conflict with what we would expect from natural selection, meaning that it is more likely that impartiality in ethics is the correct stance to pursue.<ref>Lazari-Radek, K, Singer, P., ''The Point of View of the Universe: Sidgwick and Contemporary Ethics'', Oxford University Press, 2014, pp. 182-183</ref>

[[Bernard Williams]], who was a critic of utilitarianism, said of Singer that he "is always so keen to mortify himself and tell everyone how to live". Williams criticised Singer's ethic by saying that he's "always so damn logical" and thus "leaves out an entire dimension of value". Williams claimed that Singer's utilitarianism is impractical as it's impossible to "make these calculations and comparisons in real life".<ref name=Specter />  Williams develops an extended critique of Singer for suggesting that [[speciesism]] is a prejudice roughly equivalent to sexism or racism by suggesting that we have yet to face the sort of scenarios where species membership would become a morally significant property, but that some science fiction-style thought experiments may provide such examples. He imagines an invasion of aliens who are "very disgusting indeed: their faces, for instance, if those are faces, are seething with what seem to be worms, but if we wait long enough to find out what they are at, we may gather that they are quite benevolent". Said aliens "want to live with us—rather closely with us" even though their "disgustingness is really, truly, unforgettable". Williams also suggests that another sort of alien visitors might have "much more successful experience than we have in running peaceable societies" but that they would need to exercise significant control and remove the cultural autonomy of human beings. In both scenarios, Williams argues, it would be perfectly reasonable for human beings to treat their species membership as a reasonable morally significant property.<ref>{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Bernard|title=Peter Singer under fire: the moral iconoclast faces his critics|year=2009|publisher=Open Court|location=Chicago|isbn=9780812696189|editor=Jeffrey A. Schaler|chapter=The Human Prejudice|pages=92–93}}</ref> Singer responds to Williams by arguing that the right and courageous thing to do is to make the decision without regards to species.<ref>{{cite book|last=Singer|first=Peter|title=Peter Singer under fire: the moral iconoclast faces his critics|year=2009|publisher=Open Court|location=Chicago|isbn=9780812696189|editor=Jeffrey A. Schaler|chapter=Reply to Bernard Williams|page=101}}</ref>

In a more recent critique, [[Jan Deckers]] uses a thought experiment that involves aliens once again to argue, like Williams, that speciesism makes good moral sense. Deckers argues that we should not only embrace speciesism, but also 'animalism' (an interest in attributing greater moral significance to either living or dead animals than to other biological organisms) and 'evolutionism' (an interest in ascribing greater moral significance to those animals who are biologically closer to us). Whereas Deckers shares with Singer a commitment to an interest-based ethic and to a theory that aims to maximise morally significant interests, his speciesist ethic also identifies a moral problem with the consumption of animals who die naturally or accidentally, a problem that is not recognised by Singer. In this way, this position provides a more coherent defense of qualified moral veganism that also question the consumption of [[cultured meat|in-vitro flesh]].<ref>Deckers J. Animal (De)liberation: Should the Consumption of Animal Products Be Banned?, London: Ubiquity Press, 2016; doi: https://dx.doi.org/10.5334/bay</ref>

Philosopher [[Roger Scruton]] wrote in 2000, "Singer's works, remarkably for a philosophy professor, contain little or no philosophical argument. They derive their radical moral conclusions from a vacuous utilitarianism that counts the pain and pleasure of all living things as equally significant and that ignores just about everything that has been said in our philosophical tradition about the real distinction between persons and animals".<ref>{{cite web|author=Roger Scruton |url=http://www.city-journal.org/html/10_3_urbanities-animal.html |title=Animal Rights |publisher=city-journal.org |date=Summer 2000 |accessdate=6 October 2012}}</ref>

====Political views====
Whilst a student in Melbourne, Singer campaigned against the [[Vietnam War]] as president of the Melbourne University Campaign Against Conscription.<ref name=StudentPolitics>{{cite book |last=Schaler|first=Jeffrey A. |date=30 September 2011 |title=Peter Singer Under Fire: The Moral Iconoclast Faces His Critics |publisher=Open Court |pages=7 |isbn=9780812697698}}</ref>  He also spoke publicly for the legalisation of [[abortion]] in Australia.<ref name=StudentPolitics/>

Singer joined the [[Labor Party (Australia)|Australian Labor Party]] in 1974, but resigned after disillusionment with the centrist leadership of [[Bob Hawke]].<ref name=Politics>{{cite book |last=Schaler|first=Jeffrey A. |date=30 September 2011 |title=Peter Singer Under Fire: The Moral Iconoclast Faces His Critics |publisher=Open Court |pages=58–59 |isbn=9780812697698}}</ref>  In 1992, he became a founding member of the Green Party of Victoria.<ref name=Politics/>  He has run for political office twice for the Greens: in 1994 he received 28% of the vote in the [[Kooyong by-election, 1994|Kooyong by-election]], and in 1996 he received 3% of the vote when running for the Australia Senate (elected by [[proportional representation]]).<ref name=Politics/>  Before the 1996 election, he co-authored a book ''The Greens'' with [[Bob Brown]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Singer |first1=Peter |last2=Brown |first2=Bob |date=1996 |title=The Greens |publisher=Text Publishing Company |isbn=9781875847174}}</ref>

In ''[[A Darwinian Left]]'',<ref>''A Darwinian Left: Politics, Evolution, and Cooperation'', New Haven : Yale University Press, 2000, {{ISBN|0-300-08323-8}}.</ref> Singer outlines a plan for the [[leftism|political left]] to adapt to the lessons of [[evolutionary biology]]. He says that [[evolutionary psychology]] suggests that humans naturally tend to be self-interested. He further argues that the evidence that selfish tendencies are natural must not be taken as evidence that selfishness is "right." He concludes that [[game theory]] (the mathematical study of strategy) and experiments in psychology offer hope that self-interested people will make short-term sacrifices for the good of others, if society provides the right conditions. Essentially, Singer claims that although humans possess selfish, competitive tendencies naturally, they have a substantial capacity for [[co-operation (evolution)|cooperation]] that also has been selected for during [[human evolution]]. Singer's writing in ''Greater Good'' magazine, published by the [[Greater Good Science Center]] of the [[University of California, Berkeley]], includes the interpretation of scientific research into the roots of compassion, altruism, and peaceful human relationships.

Singer describes himself as not anti-capitalist, stating in a 2010 interview with the New Left Project:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newleftproject.org/index.php/site/article_comments/ethics_and_the_left/ |title=Newleftproject.org |publisher=Newleftproject.org |date= |accessdate=23 May 2011}}</ref>

<blockquote>Capitalism is very far from a perfect system, but so far we have yet to find anything that clearly does a better job of meeting human needs than a regulated capitalist economy coupled with a welfare and health care system that meets the basic needs of those who do not thrive in the capitalist economy.</blockquote>

He added that "[i]f we ever do find a better system, I'll be happy to call myself an anti-capitalist".

Similarly, in his book ''Marx'', Singer is sympathetic to Marx's criticism of capitalism, but is skeptical about whether a better system is likely to be created, writing: "Marx saw that capitalism is a wasteful, irrational system, a system which controls us when we should be controlling it. That insight is still valid; but we can now see that the construction of a free and equal society is a more difficult task than Marx realised."<ref>''Marx: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford University Press, 2000, p.100</ref>

Singer is opposed to the death penalty, claiming that it does not effectively deter the crimes for which it is the punitive measure,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the-death-penalty---again |title=The Death Penalty – Again|work=[[Project Syndicate]] |date=11 October 2011|accessdate=10 February 2014}}</ref> and that he cannot see any other justification for it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.policyinnovations.org/ideas/audio/data/000619 |title=ETHICS MATTER: A Conversation with Peter Singer|work=[[Policy Innovations]] |date=17 October 2011|accessdate=10 February 2014}}</ref>

In 2010, Singer signed a petition renouncing his 'right of return' to Israel, which called it "a form of racist privilege that abets the colonial oppression of the Palestinians".<ref>Dan Goldberg, [http://www.thejc.com/lifestyle/interviews/72965/peter-singer-he-really-most-dangerous-man-world "Peter Singer: is he really the most dangerous man in the world?"], The Jewish Chronicle, August 16th 2012.</ref>

=====Views on the Trump administration=====
In 2016, Singer called on [[Jill Stein]] to withdraw from the [[United States presidential election, 2016|US presidential election]] in states that were close between [[Hillary Clinton]] and [[Donald Trump]], on the grounds that "The stakes are too high".<ref name=Stein>{{cite web|url=https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/jill-stein-should-withdraw-battleground-states-by-peter-singer-2016-08?barrier=true |title=Greens for Trump?|work=Project Syndicate |date=11 August 2016|accessdate=18 December 2016|last=Singer|first=Peter}}</ref>  He argued against the view that there was no significant difference between Clinton and Trump, whilst also saying that he would not advocate such a tactic in Australia's electoral system, which allows for ranking of preferences.<ref name=Stein/>

When writing in 2017 on Trump's denial of climate change and plans to withdraw from the Paris accords, Singer advocated a boycott of all consumer goods from the United States to pressure the Trump administration to change its environmental policies.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-climate-disater-boycott-america-by-peter-singer-2017-04 |title=Boycott America? |last=Singer |first=Peter |date=6 April 2017 |website=Project Syndicate |access-date=11 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/paris-accord-unfair-to-america-by-peter-singer-2017-06 |title=Is the Paris Accord Unfair to America? |last=Singer |first=Peter |date=5 June 2017 |website=Project Syndicate |access-date=11 June 2017}}</ref>

====Abortion, euthanasia, and infanticide====
Singer holds that the right to life is essentially tied to a being's capacity to hold preferences, which in turn is essentially tied to a being's capacity to feel pain and pleasure.

In ''Practical Ethics'', Singer argues in favour of [[abortion rights]] on the grounds that fetuses are neither rational nor self-aware, and can therefore hold no preferences. As a result, he argues that the preference of a mother to have an abortion automatically takes precedence. In sum, Singer argues that a fetus lacks personhood.

Similar to his argument for abortion, Singer argues that newborns lack the essential characteristics of personhood—"rationality, autonomy, and self-consciousness"<ref>[http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/1993----.htm Taking Life: Humans], Excerpted from Practical Ethics, 2nd edition, 1993</ref>—and therefore "killing a newborn baby is never equivalent to killing a person, that is, a being who wants to go on living".<ref name=SingerFAQ>Singer, Peter. [https://www.princeton.edu/~psinger/faq.html Peter Singer FAQ], Princeton University, accessed 8 March 2009.</ref>

Singer classifies [[euthanasia]] as [[voluntary euthanasia|voluntary]], [[involuntary euthanasia|involuntary]], or [[non-voluntary euthanasia|non-voluntary]]. Voluntary euthanasia is that to which the subject consents. He argues in favour of voluntary euthanasia and some forms of non-voluntary euthanasia, including infanticide in certain instances, but opposes involuntary euthanasia.

Religious critics have argued that Singer's ethic ignores and undermines the traditional notion of the [[sanctity of life]]. Singer agrees and believes the notion of the sanctity of life ought to be discarded as outdated, unscientific, and irrelevant to understanding problems in contemporary bioethics. Bioethicists associated with the [[Disability Rights]] and [[Disability Studies]] communities have argued that his epistemology is based on [[ableist]] conceptions of disability.<ref name="WOAL-interview">{{Cite book|title=Writings on an Ethical Life|first=Peter|last=Singer|chapter=An Interview|pages=319–329|isbn=1841155500}}</ref> Singer's positions have also been criticised by some advocates for [[disability rights]] and [[right-to-life]] supporters, concerned with what they see as his attacks upon [[human dignity]]. Singer has replied that many people judge him based on secondhand summaries and short quotations taken out of context, not his books or articles and, that his aim is to elevate the status of animals, not to lower that of humans.<ref>"[T]he aim of my argument is to elevate the status of animals rather than to lower the status of any humans" (''Practical Ethics'', p. 77).</ref> American publisher [[Steve Forbes]] ceased his donations to [[Princeton University]] in 1999 because of Singer's appointment to a prestigious professorship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euthanasia.com/forb.html |title=Steve Forbes Declines Princeton Financial Backing Due to Singer Hiring |publisher=Euthanasia.com |date=21 September 1999 |accessdate=23 May 2011}}</ref> Nazi-hunter [[Simon Wiesenthal]] wrote to organisers of a Swedish book fair to which Singer was invited that "A professor of morals ... who justifies the right to kill handicapped newborns ... is in my opinion unacceptable for representation at your level."<ref>Don Felder, [http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/feder102898.asp "Professor Death will fit right in at Princeton"], ''[[Jewish World Review]]'', 28 October 1998.</ref> Marc Maurer, President of the [[National Federation of the Blind]], criticised Singer's appointment to the Princeton Faculty in a banquet speech at the organisation's national convention in July 2001, claiming that Singer's support for euthanizing disabled babies could lead to disabled older children and adults being valued less as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfb.org/Images/nfb/Publications/convent/banque01.htm |title=Independence and the Necessity for Diplomacy |publisher=Nfb.org |date= |accessdate=23 May 2011}}</ref> Conservative psychiatrist [[Theodore Dalrymple]] wrote in 2010 that Singerian moral universalism is "preposterous—psychologically, theoretically, and practically".<ref>{{cite book |ref=harv |last= Dalrymple |first= Theodore |title=[[Spoilt Rotten: The Toxic Cult of Sentimentality]] |publisher=Gibson Square Books Ltd |year=2010 |isbn=1-906142-61-0|page=226}}</ref>

In 2002 disability rights activist [[Harriet McBryde Johnson]] debated Singer, challenging his belief that it is morally permissible to [[euthanasia|euthanize]] new-born children with severe disabilities. "Unspeakable Conversations", Johnson's account of her encounters with Singer and the pro-euthanasia movement, was published in the ''New York Times Magazine'' in 2003. It also served as inspiration for ''The Thrill'', a 2013 play by [[Judith Thompson]] partly based on Johnson's life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stratfordbeaconherald.com/2013/08/14/strength-of-judith-thompsons-new-play-the-thrill-is-asking-provocative-complex-questions"|first=Donal|last=O'Connor|title=Strength of Judith Thompson's new play The Thrill is asking provocative, complex questions|publisher=Stratford Beaconherald|date=2013-08-16}}</ref>

Singer has experienced the complexities of some of these questions in his own life. His mother had [[Alzheimer's disease]]. He said, "I think this has made me see how the issues of someone with these kinds of problems are really very difficult".<ref>Quoted in Michael Specter, "[http://www.michaelspecter.com/1999/09/the-dangerous-philosopher/ The Dangerous Philosopher]", ''[[The New Yorker]]'', 6 September 1999.</ref> In an interview with [[Ronald Bailey]], published in December 2000, he explained that his sister shares the responsibility of making decisions about his mother. He did say that, if he were solely responsible, his mother might not continue to live.<ref>Ronald Bailey, "[http://www.reason.com/0012/rb.the.shtml The Pursuit of Happiness]", ''[[Reason (magazine)]]'', December 2000.</ref>

====Surrogacy====
In 1985, Singer wrote a book with the physician Deanne Wells arguing that surrogate motherhood should be allowed and regulated by the state by establishing nonprofit 'State Surrogacy Boards', which would ensure fairness between surrogate mothers and surrogacy-seeking parents. Singer and Wells endorsed both the payment of medical expenses endured by surrogate mothers and an extra "fair fee" to compensate the surrogate mother.<ref>{{cite book|last=Singer|first=Peter|title=Making babies: The New Science and Ethics of Conception|year=1985|publisher=C.

Frey and Christopher Heath Wellman|title=A Companion to Applied Ethics|chapter=Chapter 27: Surrogate Motherhood|page=376|isbn=1557865949}}</ref>

====Bestiality====
In a 2001 review of Midas Dekkers' ''Dearest Pet: On Bestiality'', Singer comments on writer [[Otto Soyka]]'s opinion about bestiality.  Soyka says that attempts to outlaw bestiality are futile, but sexual activities between humans and animals that result in harm to the animal should remain illegal, but that "sex with animals does not always involve cruelty" and that "mutually satisfying activities" would be condoned by Soyka.<ref name=SingerNerve>Singer, Peter. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316030814/http://www.nerve.com/Opinions/Singer/heavyPetting/main.asp |date=16 March 2008 |title=Heavy Petting }}, ''Nerve'', 2001. Archived from [http://www.nerve.com/Opinions/Singer/heavyPetting/main.asp the original] on 16 March 2008</ref> Soyka's position is countered by fellow philosopher [[Tom Regan]], who writes that the same argument could be used to justify having [[sex with children]]. Regan writes that determining the right or wrong of bestiality based only on cruelty is a [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]], or [[Consequentialism|consequentialist]], approach to animal rights, rather than a strictly [[Deontological ethics|rights-based]] one, and argues that the rights-based position distances itself from non-consensual sex.<ref name=Regan63>Regan, Tom. ''Animal Rights, Human Wrongs''. Rowman & Littlefield, 2003, pp. 63–4, 89.</ref>

[[File:Peter Singer.jpg|thumb|Singer lecturing at [[Oxford University]]]]

====Religion====
Singer was a speaker at the 2012 [[Global Atheist Convention]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atheistconvention.org.au/peter-singer/ |title=Peter Singer|work=.atheistconvention.org.au |accessdate=1 December 2013}}</ref> He has debated with Christians such as [[John Lennox]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/bigideas/stories/2011/09/06/3310342.htm |title=Singer vs Lennox: Is There a God?|work=ABC.net.au|date=6 September 2011|accessdate=1 December 2013}}</ref> and [[Dinesh D'Souza]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://paw.princeton.edu/issues/2009/01/28/pages/5588/index.xml|title=Singer, D’Souza face off over religion and morality|work=Princeton Alumni Weekly|date=28 January 2009|accessdate=1 December 2013}}</ref> Singer has pointed out [[the problem of evil]] as an objection against the Christian conception of God. He stated: "The evidence of our own eyes makes it more plausible to believe that the world was not created by any god at all. If, however, we insist on believing in divine creation, we are forced to admit that the god who made the world cannot be all-powerful and all good. He must be either evil or a bungler."<ref name="god">{{cite web|url=http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the-god-of-suffering-|title=The God of Suffering?|author=Peter Singer|work=Project Syndicate|date=8 May 2008|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref> In keeping with his considerations of non-human animals, Singer also takes issue with the original sin reply to the problem of evil, saying that, "animals also suffer from floods, fires, and droughts, and, since they are not descended from Adam and Eve, they cannot have inherited original sin."<ref name="god"/>

==== Protests ====
In 1989 and 1990, Peter Singer's work was the subject of a number of protests in Germany. A course in ethics led by Dr. Hartmut Kliemt at the [[University of Duisburg]] where the main text used was Singer's ''Practical Ethics'' was, according to Singer, "subjected to organized and repeated disruption by protesters objecting to the use of the book on the grounds that in one of its ten chapters it advocates active euthanasia for severely disabled newborn infants". The protests led to the course being shut down.<ref name="SilencedInGermany">{{Cite book|title=Writings on an Ethical Life|first=Peter|last=Singer|chapter=On Being Silenced in Germany|pages=303–318|isbn=1841155500}}</ref>

When Singer tried to speak during a lecture at [[Saarbrücken]], he was interrupted by a group of protesters including advocates for [[disability rights]]. One of the protesters expressed that entering serious discussions would be a tactical error.<ref>Holger Dorf, "Singer in Saabrücken", ''Unirevue'' (Winter Semester, 1989/90), p.47.</ref>

The same year, Singer was invited to speak in [[Marburg]] at a European symposium on "Bioengineering, Ethics and Mental Disability". The invitation was fiercely attacked by leading intellectuals and organisations in German media, with an article in ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' comparing Singer's positions to [[Nazism]]. Eventually, the symposium was cancelled and Singer's invitation consequently withdrawn.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sheri Berman|url=http://bc.barnard.edu/~sberman/Pages/publications/Brill.pdf|title= Euthanasia, Eugenics and Fascism: How Close are the Connections|publisher=German Politics and Society 17(3)|date= Fall 1999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402234446/http://bc.barnard.edu/~sberman/Pages/publications/Brill.pdf|archivedate=2 April 2012}}</ref>

A lecture at the Zoological Institute of the [[University of Zurich]] also was interrupted by two groups of protesters. The first group was a group of disabled people who staged a brief protest at the beginning of the lecture. They objected to inviting an advocate of euthanasia to speak. At the end of this protest, when Singer tried to address their concerns, a second group of protesters rose and began chanting "''Singer raus! Singer raus!''" ("Singer out!") When Singer attempted to respond, a protester jumped on stage and grabbed his glasses, and the host ended the lecture. The first group of protesters was distressed by this second, more aggressive group. It had not intended to halt the lecture and even had questions to ask Singer. Singer explains "my views are not threatening to anyone, even minimally" and says that some groups play on the anxieties of those who hear only keywords that are understandably worrying (given the constant fears of ever repeating the Holocaust) if taken with any less than the full context of his belief system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://criticanarede.com/html/ed99.html |title=Criticanarede.com |publisher=Criticanarede.com |date= |accessdate=23 May 2011}}</ref><ref>Practical Ethics second edition, 1993, {{ISBN|0-521-43363-0}}. pp. 346–359.</ref>

In 1991, Singer was due to speak along with [[R. M. Hare]] and Georg Meggle at the 15th [[International Wittgenstein Symposium]] in [[Kirchberg am Wechsel]], [[Austria]]. Singer has stated that threats were made to Adolf Hübner, then the president of the Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society, that the conference would be disrupted if Singer and Meggle were given a platform. Hübner proposed to the board of the society that Singer's invitation (as well as the invitations of a number of other speakers) be withdrawn. The Society decided to cancel the symposium.<ref name="SilencedInGermany" />

In an article originally published in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', Singer argued that the protests dramatically increased the amount of coverage he got: "instead of a few hundred people hearing views at lectures in Marburg and Dortmund, several millions read about them or listened to them on television". Despite this, Singer argues that it has led to a difficult intellectual climate, with professors in Germany unable to teach courses on applied ethics and campaigns demanding the resignation of professors who invited Singer to speak.<ref name="SilencedInGermany" />

==Honours==
Singer was inducted into the United States [[Animal Rights Hall of Fame]] in 2000.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://arconference.org/ARHOF.htm |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071204225405/http://arconference.org/ARHOF.htm |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 4 December 2007 |title= U.S. Animal Rights Hall of Fame |publisher= Farm Animal Rights Movement |location= [[Bethesda, Maryland]] |accessdate= 20 November 2012 |quote= }}</ref>

On 11 June 2012, Singer was appointed a [[Order of Australia|Companion of the Order of Australia]] (AC) for "eminent service to philosophy and bioethics as a leader of public debate and communicator of ideas in the areas of global poverty, animal welfare and the human condition."<ref name=companion>{{cite web|title=Companion (AC) in the General Division of the Order of Australia – The Queen's Birthday 2012 Honours Lists|url=http://www.gg.gov.au/res/file/2012/honours/qb2012/Media%20Notes%20AC%20(final).pdf|publisher=[[Official Secretary to the Governor-General of Australia]]|page=[http://www.gg.gov.au/res/file/2012/honours/qb2012/Media%20Notes%20AC%20(final).pdf#page=8 8]|date=11 June 2012}}</ref>
