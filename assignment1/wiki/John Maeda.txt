Maeda was originally a [[Computer Science]] student at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], where he became fascinated with the work of [[Paul Rand]] and [[Muriel Cooper]]. Cooper was a director of MIT's Visible Language Workshop. After completing his bachelor's and master's degrees at MIT, Maeda studied in Japan at [[Tsukuba University]]'s Institute of Art and Design to complete his Ph.D. in design.

As an artist, Maeda’s early work redefined the use of electronic media as a tool for expression by combining computer programming with traditional artistic technique, laying the groundwork for the interactive motion graphics that are taken for granted on the web today. He has exhibited in one-man shows in London, New York and Paris. His work is in the permanent collections of the [[Museum of Modern Art]], the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]] and the [[Fondation Cartier pour l'Art Contemporain|Cartier Foundation]] in Paris.

At RISD, Maeda led the movement to transform [[Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics|STEM]] (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) to [[STEAM fields|STEAM]] by adding Art. He states:<blockquote>I believe art and design are poised to transform our economy in the 21st century like science and technology did in the last century<ref name="Congressional STEAM Event">{{cite web | url        = https://bonamici.house.gov/press-release/reps-bonamici-and-schock-announce-bipartisan-congressional-steam-caucus

In 1999, he was named one of the 21 most important people in the 21st century by ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]''.<ref>{{cite web

In 2006, Maeda published ''Laws of Simplicity'', his best-selling book to date, based on a research project to find ways for people to simplify their life in the face of growing complexity.

In 2009 he was inducted into the New York Art Director’s Club Hall of Fame, and he received the AIGA Medal in 2010.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.aiga.org/medalist-johnmaeda|title=2010 AIGA Medalist: John Maeda|newspaper=AIGA {{!}} the professional association for design|access-date=2017-02-19}}</ref> He is a trustee of the [[Cooper–Hewitt, National Design Museum]].<ref>{{cite web
