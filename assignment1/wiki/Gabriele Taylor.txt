'''E. Gabriele Taylor''' (born 11 October 1927) is a British philosopher and university teacher. She was Fellow and Tutor in Philosophy at [[St Anne's College, Oxford]] until her retirement in 1996. She notably taught the philosophers [[Roger Crisp]] and [[Constantine Sandis]], and the politicians [[Edwina Currie]] and [[Danny Alexander]]. Since then she has continued work as a Senior Research Fellow of the College, pursuing her own particular interests in [[ethics]].

== Early life and education ==
Taylor was born in 1927 and grew up in Berlin. Her early education was disturbed by the war and at the conclusion of hostilities she and her family found themselves in the British sector of the occupied city. She worked for a while with the [[Red Cross]] but ultimately was able to travel to England in 1947 to join a relative already in the country. She then worked part-time whilst also studying and then was successful in gaining a place at St Anne’s in 1952 to read [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]] (PPE). She went on to study for the BPhil in Philosophy, which she completed in 1957.<ref>http://www.st-annes.ox.ac.uk/about/people/profile?tx_oxford_pi1%5Bstaff%5D=302&cHash=0b157028d1dd499a05dfcf5c2c231843</ref>

== Academic career ==

On completing her BPhil, Taylor started her teaching career as a lecturer in Philosophy at St Anne’s, working alongside [[Iris Murdoch]], who had been a Fellow of the College since 1948.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.st-annes.ox.ac.uk/about/people/supernumerary-emeritus-honorary-and-senior-research-fellows.html |accessdate=August 12, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710101401/http://www.st-annes.ox.ac.uk/about/people/supernumerary-emeritus-honorary-and-senior-research-fellows.html |archivedate=July 10, 2011 }}</ref> Following a spell in Australia teaching at [[Canberra University College]], on her return to England she rejoined the College as a lecturer in 1962 and became a Fellow of the College in 1964. During her career as Fellow and Tutor she taught undergraduates reading most of the Honour Schools involving philosophy as well as supervising graduate students. In the [[Faculty of Philosophy, University of Oxford]], Taylor also examined and lectured  on moral philosophy, [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and the [[British Empiricists]] and gave revision classes on the history of philosophy.

== Academic interests ==
In her role as tutor for the PPE school, Taylor taught the general and moral philosophy courses and special papers for PPE final examinations, and also taught elementary [[formal logic]] to first year undergraduates. 

Her own research has focused on [[moral psychology]], with a particular interest in the ‘ordinary’ vices traditionally seen as death to the soul.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://philpapers.org/s/Gabriele%20Taylor |title=Works by Gabriele Taylor |publisher=PhilPapers |date= |accessdate=2013-10-26}}</ref> Her best-known works are probably ''Pride, Shame and Guilt'' ([[Oxford University Press]] 1985)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780198246206.do?keyword=gabriele+taylor&sortby=bestMatches |title=Pride, Shame, and Guilt: Gabriele Taylor - Oxford University Press |publisher=Ukcatalogue.oup.com |date=1985-10-24 |accessdate=2013-10-26}}</ref> and ''Deadly Vices'' ([[Clarendon Press]] 2006),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780198235804.do?keyword=deadly+vices&sortby=bestMatches |title=Deadly Vices: Hardback: Gabriele Taylor - Oxford University Press |publisher=Ukcatalogue.oup.com |date=2006-06-08 |accessdate=2013-10-26}}</ref> which examine the beliefs involved in the experience of these emotions.
