It became increasingly possible for individuals to combine orthodox theology (''kalam'') and Sufism, while adherents of both camps developed a sense of mutual appreciation that made sweeping condemnation of one by the other increasingly problematic.<ref name="Watt1953" />

==Life==

The traditional date of al-Ghazali's birth, as given by [[Abu'l-Faraj ibn al-Jawzi|Ibn al-Jawzi]], is 450 [[Hijri year|AH]] (March 1058 – February 1059 CE), but modern scholars have raised doubts about the [[accuracy]] of Ibn al-Jawzi's information, and have posited a date of 448 AH (1056–1057 CE), on the basis of certain statements in al-Ghazali's correspondence and autobiography.<ref name=Griffel>{{cite book|last=Griffel|first=Frank|title=Al-Ghazālī's Philosophical Theology|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780195331622}}</ref>{{rp|23–25}} He was born in Tabaran, a town in the district of [[Tus, Iran|Tus]], which lies within the [[Khorasan Province]] of [[Iran]].<ref name=Griffel />{{rp|25}}

A posthumous tradition—the authenticity of which has been questioned in recent scholarship—tells that his father died in poverty and left the young al-Ghazali and his brother [[Ahmad Ghazali|Ahmad]] to the care of a [[Sufi]]. Al-Ghazali's contemporary and first biographer, 'Abd al-Ghafir al-Farisi, records merely that al-Ghazali began to receive instruction in ''[[fiqh]]'' (Islamic jurisprudence) from Ahmad al-Radhakani, a local teacher.<ref name=Griffel />{{rp|26–27}}

He later studied under [[al-Juwayni]], the distinguished jurist and theologian and "the most outstanding Muslim scholar of his time",<ref name=Griffel />{{rp|29}}in [[Nishapur]], perhaps after a period of study in [[Gurgan]]. After al-Juwayni's death in 1085,  al-Ghazali departed from Nishapur and joined the court of [[Nizam al-Mulk]], the powerful vizier of the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]] sultans, which was likely centered in [[Isfahan]]. After bestowing upon him the titles of "Brilliance of the Religion" and "Eminence among the Religious Leaders", Nizam al-Mulk advanced al-Ghazali in July 1091 to the "most prestigious and most challenging" professoriate at the time, in the [[Nizamiyya]] madrasa in [[Baghdad]].<ref name=Griffel />{{rp|34}}

He underwent a spiritual crisis in 1095, and consequently abandoned his career and left Baghdad on the pretext of going on pilgrimage to [[Mecca]]. Making arrangements for his family, he disposed of his wealth and adopted an ascetic lifestyle. According to biographer, Duncan B. Macdonald, the purpose of abstaining from scholastic work was to confront the spiritual experience and more ordinary understanding of "the Word and the Traditions".<ref>Nicholson, Reynold Alleyne. (1966). "A literary history of the Arabs". London: Cambridge University Press. p. 382.</ref> After some time in [[Damascus]] and [[Jerusalem]], with a visit to [[Medina]] and Mecca in 1096, he returned to Tus to spend the next several years in '''uzla'' (seclusion). This seclusion consisted in abstaining from teaching at state-sponsored institutions, though he continued to publish, to receive visitors, and to teach in the [[Zawiya (institution)|zawiya]] (private madrasa) and [[khanqah]] (Sufi monastery) that he had built.

Fakhr al-Mulk, grand vizier to [[Ahmad Sanjar]], pressed al-Ghazali to return to the Nizamiyya in Nishapur; al-Ghazali reluctantly capitulated in 1106, fearing (rightly) that he and his teachings would meet with resistance and controversy.<ref name=Griffel />{{rp|53–4}} He later returned to Tus, and declined an invitation in 1110 from the grand vizier of [[Muhammad I (Seljuq sultan)|Muhammad I]] to return to Baghdad. He died on 19 December 1111. According to 'Abd al-Ghafir al-Farisi he had several daughters, but no sons.<ref name=Griffel />{{rp|57–59}}

==School affiliations==
Al-Ghazali contributed significantly to the development of a systematic view of [[Sufism]] and to its integration and acceptance in mainstream Islam. As a scholar of orthodox Islam, he belonged to the [[Shafi'i]] school of Islamic [[jurisprudence]] and to the [[Ash'ari|Asharite]] school of [[theology]].<ref name="ReferenceA">R.M. Frank, ''Al-Ghazali and the Ash'arite School'', Duke University Press, London 1994</ref>  Al-Ghazali received many titles such as ''Sharaf-ul-Aʾimma'' ({{lang|ar|شرف الأئمة}}), ''Zayn-ud-dīn'' ({{lang|ar|زين الدين}}), ''Ḥujjat-ul-Islām'' ({{lang|ar|حجة الإسلام}}).

He is viewed{{by whom|date=August 2014}} as the key member of the influential [[Asharite]] school of [[early Muslim philosophy]] and as the most important refuter of the [[Mutazilite]]s. However, he chose a slightly different position in comparison with the Asharites; his beliefs and thoughts differ, in some aspects, from the orthodox Asharite school.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

==Works==
[[File:Haruniyeh.JPG|thumb|Haruniyah ({{lang|fa|هارونیه}}) structure in [[Tus, Iran|Tus]], [[Iran]], named after [[Harun al-Rashid]], the mausoleum of Al-Ghazali is thought to be situated at the entrance of this monument]]

Al-Ghazali wrote more than 70 books on the sciences, Islamic philosophy and Sufism.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===''Incoherence of the Philosophers''===
His 11th century book titled ''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]'' marks a major turn in Islamic [[epistemology]]. The encounter with [[skepticism]] led al-Ghazali to embrace a form of theological [[occasionalism]], or the belief that all causal events and interactions are not the product of material conjunctions but rather the immediate and present Will of God.

The ''Incoherence'' also marked a turning point in Islamic philosophy in its vehement rejections of [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]]. The book took aim at the ''falasifa'', a loosely defined group of Islamic philosophers from the 8th through the 11th centuries (most notable among them [[Avicenna]] and [[Al-Farabi]]) who drew intellectually upon the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]].

In the next century, [[Averroes]] drafted a lengthy rebuttal of al-Ghazali's ''Incoherence'' entitled ''[[The Incoherence of the Incoherence]]''; however, the epistemological course of Islamic thought had already been set.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Craig|first1=William Lane|title=The cosmological argument from Plato to Leibniz|date=2001|publisher=Wipf and Stock|location=Eugene, OR.|isbn=978-1579107871|page=89}}</ref>  Al-Ghazali gave as an example of the illusion of independent laws of cause the fact that cotton burns when coming into contact with fire.  While it might seem as though  a natural law was at work, it happened each and every time only because God willed it to happen—the event was "a direct product of divine intervention as any more attention grabbing miracle". [[Averroes]], by contrast insisted while God created the natural law, humans "could more usefully say that fire cause cotton to burn—because creation had a pattern that they could discern."<ref name=Kadri-118>{{cite book|last1=Kadri|first1=Sadakat|title=Heaven on Earth: A Journey Through Shari'a Law from the Deserts of Ancient Arabia ..|date=2012|publisher=macmillan|isbn=9780099523277|pages=118–9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ztCRZOhJ10wC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Heaven+on+Earth:+A+Journey+Through+Shari%27a+Law#v=onepage&q=Heaven%20on%20Earth%3A%20A%20Journey%20Through%20Shari'a%20Law&f=false}}</ref>

This long-held argument has been disputed. Some argue that al-Ghazali was the first intellectual to champion the separation between several disciplines formerly classified under ''falsafa'' (an Arabic word for philosophy but one that used to include physics, mathematics and logic).<ref name="thenational.ae">{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/thenationalconversation/comment/how-the-decline-of-muslim-scientific-thought-still-haunts#full |title=How the decline of Muslim scientific thought still haunts |publisher=thenational.ae |date= |accessdate=2012-10-04}}</ref> "Al-Ghazali argued that some fundamentalists, who perceive ''falsafa'' to be incompatible with religion, tend to categorically reject all views adopted by 'philosophers', including scientific facts like the lunar and solar eclipses. And when that person is later persuaded of a certain view, he tends to blindly accept all other views held by philosophers".<ref name="thenational.ae"/>

===Autobiography===
[[File:Munqidh min al-dalal (last page).jpg|thumb|Last page of Al-Ghazali's autobiography in MS Istanbul, Shehid Ali Pasha 1712{{clarify|date=June 2015}}<!--what do these numbers mean, they look like an AD year, which is confusing-->, dated [[Anno Hegirae|AH]] 509 ([[Anno Domini|AD]] 1115-1116).]]

The [[autobiography]] al-Ghazali wrote towards the end of his life, ''Deliverance From Error'' ({{lang|ar|المنقذ من الضلال}} ''al-munqidh min al-ḍalāl'') is considered a work of major importance.<ref name=Iranica>{{cite web|last=B&ouml;wering|first=Gerhard|title=ḠAZĀLĪ|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/gazali-i-biography|work=Encyclopædia Iranica|accessdate=17 December 2012}}</ref> In it, al-Ghazali recounts how, once a crisis of [[epistemological skepticism]] was resolved by "a light which God Most High cast into my breast ... the key to most knowledge,"<ref name=McCarthy>{{cite book|last=McCarthy|first=Richard Joseph|title=Freedom and fulfillment: "al-Munqidh min al-Dalal" and other relevant works|year=1980|publisher=Twayne|location=Boston|isbn=0805781676}}</ref>{{rp|66}} he studied and mastered the arguments of [[kalam]], [[Islamic philosophy]], and [[Ismailism]]. Though appreciating what was valid in the first two of these, at least, he determined that all three approaches were inadequate and found ultimate value only in the mystical experience and insight (the state of prophecy or ''nubuwwa''){{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} he attained as a result of following [[Sufi]] practices. [[William James]], in ''[[Varieties of Religious Experience]]'', considered the autobiography an important document for "the purely literary student who would like to become acquainted with the inwardness of religions other than the Christian" because of the scarcity of recorded personal religious confessions and autobiographical literature from this period outside the Christian tradition.<ref name=James>{{cite book|last=James|first=William|title=The Varieties of Religious Experience.|year=2012|publisher=Oxford Univ Press|isbn=9780199691647|editor=Bradley, Matthew}}</ref>{{rp|307}}

===''The Revival of Religious Sciences''===
{{See also|The Alchemy of Happiness}}
Another of al-Ghazali's major works is ''Ihya' Ulum al-Din'' or ''Ihya'u Ulumiddin'' (''The Revival of Religious Sciences''). It covers almost all fields of Islamic sciences: [[fiqh]] (Islamic [[jurisprudence]]), [[kalam]] ([[theology]]) and [[sufism]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

It contains four major sections: ''Acts of worship'' (Rub' al-'ibadat), ''Norms of Daily Life'' (Rub' al-'adatat), ''The ways to Perdition'' (Rub' al-muhlikat) and ''The Ways to Salvation'' (Rub' al-munjiyat). The ''Ihya'' became the most frequently recited Islamic text after the Qur'an and the hadith. Its great achievement was to bring orthodox Sunni theology and Sufi mysticism together in a useful, comprehensive guide to every aspect of Muslim life and death.<ref>Hunt Janin, The Pursuit of Learning in the Islamic World 610-2003, p 83. {{ISBN|0786429046}}</ref> The book was well received by Islamic scholars such as [[Yahya ibn Sharaf al-Nawawi|Nawawi]] who stated that: "Were the books of Islam all to be lost, excepting only the Ihya', it would suffice to replace them all."<ref>Joseph E. B. Lumbard, Islam, Fundamentalism, and the Betrayal of Tradition: Essays by Western Muslim Scholars, p. 291. {{ISBN|0941532607}}</ref>

Ghazali rewrote ''The Revival of Religious Sciences'' in [[Persian language|Persian]] to reach a more massive audience; he published this book under the name ''[[The Alchemy of Happiness]]''.

===''The Jerusalem Tract''===
At the insistence of his students in Jerusalem, al-Ghazali wrote a concise exposition of Islam entitled ''The Jerusalem Tract''.<ref name=Khalidi>{{cite book|last=Khalidi|first=Walid|title=Before their diaspora : a photographic history of the Palestinians, 1876-1948|year=1984|publisher=Institute for Palestine Studies|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0887281435|url=http://btd.palestine-studies.org/content/introduction-last-days-ottoman-rule-1876-1918|author2=Khalidi, commentary by Walid}}</ref>{{rp|29}}

===Works in Persian===

Al-Ghazali wrote most of his works in [[Arabic]] and few in [[Persian language|Persian]]. His most important Persian work is [[Kimiya-yi sa'ādat|''Kīmyāyé Sa'ādat'']] (The Alchemy of Happiness). It is al-Ghazali's own Persian version of ''Ihya'ul ulumuddin'' (The Revival of Religious Sciences) in Arabic, but a shorter work. It is one of the outstanding works of 11th-century-Persian literature. The book was published several times in [[Tehran]] by the edition of Hussain Khadev-jam, a renowned Iranian scholar. It is translated to [[English language|English]], [[Arabic]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Urdu]], [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] and other languages.<ref>Translated into English by Mohammed Asim Bilal and available at [https://archive.org/details/KimiyaISaadatAnEnglishTranslationOfImamGhazzalisAlchemyOfEternalBlissabuHamidAlGhazali archive.org]</ref>

Apart from Kimya, the most celebrated of al-Ghazali's works in Persian is '''Nasīhatul Mulūk'' (The Counseling Kings), written most probably for Sultan [[Ahmed Sanjar|Ahmad Sanjar ibn Malekshah]]. In the edition published by Jalāluddīn Humāyī, the book consists of two parts of which only the first can reliably be attributed to al-Ghazali. The language and the contents of some passages are similar to the Kimyaye Sa'adat. The second part differs considerably in content and style from the well-known writings of al-Ghazali. It contains the stories of pre-Islamic kings of [[Persia]], especially those of [[Khosrau I|Anoshervān]]. Nasihatul Muluk was early translated to Arabic under the title '' al-Tibr al-masbuk fi nasihat al-muluk'' (The Forged Sword in Counseling Kings).

''Zād-e Ākherat'' (Provision for the hereafter) is an important Persian book of al-Ghazali but gained less scholarly attention. The greater part of it consists of the Persian translation of one of his Arabic books, ''Bedāyat al-Hedāya'' (Beginning of Guidance). It contains in addition the same contents as the Kīmyāyé Sa'ādat. The book was most probably written during the last years of his life. Its manuscripts are in [[Kabul]] (Library of the Department of Press) and in [[Leiden]].

'''Pand-nāma''' (Book of Counsel) is another book of advice and probably attributed to Sultan Sanjar. The introduction to the book relates that Al-Ghazali wrote the book in response to a certain king who had asked him for advice. '''Ay farzand''' (O son!) is a short book of counsel that al-Ghazali wrote for one of his students. The book was early translated to Arabic entitled ''ayyuhal walad''. Another Persian work is '''Hamāqāti ahli ibāhat''' or '''Raddi ebāhīyya''' (Condemnation of antinomians) which is his ''[[fatwa]]'' in Persian illustrated with [[Quran]]ic verses and [[Hadith]]s.

'''Faza'ilul al-anam min rasa'ili hujjat al-Islam''' is the collection of letters in Persian that al-Ghazali wrote in response to the kings, ministers, jurists and some of his friends after he returned to  [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]]. The collection was gathered by one of his grandchildren after his death, under five sections/chapters. The longest letter is the response to objections raised against some of his statements in ''Mishkat al-Anwar'' (The Niche of Light) and ''al-Munqidh min al-dalal'' (Rescuer from Error). The first letter is the one which al-Ghazali wrote to [[Ahmed Sanjar|Sultan Sanjar]] presenting his excuse for teaching in [[Nizamiyya]] of [[Nishapur]]; followed by al-Ghazali's speech in the court of Sultan Sanjar. Al-Ghazali makes an impressive speech when he was taken to the king's court in Nishapur in 1106, giving very influential counsels, asking the sultan once again for excusing him from teaching in Nizamiyya. The sultan was so impressed that he ordered al-Ghazali to write down his speech so that it will be sent to all the [[ulema]]s of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and [[Persian Iraq|Iraq]].

==Influence==

Al-Ghazali had an important influence on both later [[Muslim philosophers]] and [[Christian]] [[Medieval philosophy|medieval philosophers]]. [[Margaret Smith (author)|Margaret Smith]] writes in her book ''Al-Ghazali: The Mystic'' (London 1944): "There can be no doubt that al-Ghazali’s works would be among the first to attract the attention of these European scholars" (page 220). Then she emphasizes, "The greatest of these Christian writers who was influenced by al-Ghazali was St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274), who made a study of the Arabic writers and admitted his indebtedness to them, having studied at the [[University of Naples]] where the influence of Arab literature and culture was predominant at the time." In addition, Aquinas' interest in Islamic studies could be attributed to the infiltration of ‘Latin Averroism’ in the 13th century, especially at the [[University of Paris]].

Dimitri Gutas and the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] consider the period between the 11th and 14th centuries to be the "[[Islamic Golden Age|Golden Age]]" of Arabic and Islamic philosophy, initiated by Ghazali's successful integration of [[Logic in Islamic philosophy|logic into the Islamic]] seminary [[Madrasah]] curriculum.<ref name=Stanford>{{cite web|author=Tony Street|title=Arabic and Islamic Philosophy of Language and Logic|publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|date=July 23, 2008|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/arabic-islamic-language|accessdate=2008-12-05}}</ref> He was the first to apply the [[Avicennism#Avicennian logic|Avicennian system]] of [[Temporal logic|temporal]] [[modal logic]] to [[Islamic theology]].<ref name=Britannica>[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-65928 History of logic: Arabic logic] ([http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090702064323/http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-65928 Internet Archive]), ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.</ref>

Al-Ghazali also played a very major role in integrating [[Sufism]] with [[Shariah]]. He was also the first to present a formal description of Sufism in his works. His works also strengthened the status of [[Sunni Islam]] against other schools. The [[Batiniyya|Batinite]] ([[Ismailism]]) had emerged in [[Persia]]n territories and were gaining more and more power during al-Ghazali's period, as [[Nizam al-Mulk]] was assassinated by the members of Ismailis. Al-Ghazali strongly rejected their ideology and wrote several books on criticism of Baatinyas which significantly weakened their status.

Al-Ghazali succeeded in gaining widespread acceptance for Sufism at the expense of philosophy.<ref name=sells>{{cite book|author=Sells, Michael Anthony|title=Early Islamic Mysticism: Sufi, Qurʼan, Miraj, Poetic and Theological Writings|publisher=New York: Paulist|year=1996|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BrU54SYQSyoC&pg=PA24|isbn=9780809136193}}</ref> At the same time, in his refutation of philosophers he made use of their philosophical categories and thus helped to give them wider circulation.<ref name=sells/>

== List of works ==
Al-Ghazali had mentioned the number of his works "more than 70", in one of his letters to [[Ahmed Sanjar|Sultan Sanjar]] in the late years of his life. However, there are more than 400 books attributed to him today. Making a judgment on the number of his works and their attribution to al-Ghazali is a difficult step. Many western scholars such as [[William Montgomery Watt]] (''The works attributed to Al-Ghazali''), Maurice Bouyges (''Essai de chronologie des oeuvres d'Al-Ghazali'') and others prepared a list of his works along with their comments on each book.

Finally, [[Abdel Rahman Badawi]], an Egyptian scholar, prepared a comprehensive list of al-Ghazali's works under 457 titles:
* from 1 to 72: works definitely written by al-Ghazali
* from 73 to 95: works of doubtful attribution
* 96 - 127: works which are not those of al-Ghazali with most certainty
* 128 - 224: are the names of the Chapters or Sections of al-Ghazali's books that are mistakenly thought books of his

==Reception of his work==
According to [[William Montgomery Watt]], Al-Ghazali considered himself to be the [[Mujaddid]] (Revivier) of his age. Many, perhaps most, later Muslims concurred and according to Watt, some have even considered him to be the greatest Muslim after the Prophet Muhammad.<ref>William Montgomery Watt, ''Al-Ghazali: The Muslim Intellectual'', p. 180. [[Edinburgh]]: [[Edinburgh University Press]], 1963.</ref>

As an example, the Islamic scholar al-Safadi states: {{cquote| Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Ahmad, the Proof of Islam, Ornament of the Faith, Abu Hamid al-Tusi (al-Ghazali) the Shafi'ite jurist, was in his later years without rival<ref>al-Wafa bi'l wafayat, p. 274 - 277. Also see Tabaqat al-Shafiyya, subki, 4, 101.</ref>}}

and the jurist, al-Yafi'i stated that:

{{cquote| 
He was called The Proof of Islam and undoubtedly was worthy of the name, absolutely trustworthy (in respect of the Faith) How many an epitome (has he given) us setting forth the basic principles of religion: how much that was repetitive has he summarised, and epitomised what was lengthy. How many a simple explanation has he given us of what was hard to fathom, with brief elucidation and clear solution of knotty problems. He used moderation, being quiet but decisive in silencing an adversary, though his words were like a sharp sword-thrust in refuting a slanderer and protecting the high-road of guidance.<ref>Margaret Smith, Al-Ghazali, The Mystic, p. 47</ref>
}}

The Shafi'i jurist al-Subki stated that:

{{cquote| 
"If there had been a prophet after Muhammad, al-Ghazali would have been the man".<ref>Tabaqat al-Shafi’iyyah al-Kubra, Cairo, 1324/1906, Vol. IV, p. 101</ref><ref>Margaret Smith, Al-Ghazali, The Mystic, p. 48</ref> 
}}

Also a widely considered [[Sunni]] scholar [[Al-Dhahabi|Al Dhahabi]] in wrote praise of Al Ghazali: “Al-Ghazzaali, the imaam and shaykh, the prominent scholar, Hujjat al-Islam, the wonder of his time, Zayn al-Deem Abu Haamid Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Toosi al-Shaafa’i al-Ghazzaali, the author of many books and one possessed of utter intelligence. He studied fiqh in his own town, then he moved to Nisapur in the company of a group of students. He stayed with the Imaam al-Haramayn and gained a deep knowledge of fiqh within a short period. He became well-versed in ‘ilm al-kalaam and debate, until he became the best of debater.”<ref>{{Cite book|title = Siyar A’laam al-Nubala’|last = Al-Dhahabi|first = |publisher = Dar Al-Hadith|year = |isbn = |location = Lebanon|pages = 323|volume = 9}}</ref>

[[Averroes|Ibn Rushd]] (Averroes), a rationalist, famously responded that "to say that philosophers are incoherent is itself to make an incoherent statement."{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Rushd's book, ''The Incoherence of the Incoherence'', attempted to refute al-Ghazali's views, though the work was not well received in the Muslim community.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Ornament_of_the_World.html?id=4dxbqEmU-OkC&redir_esc=y|title=The Ornament of the World: How Muslims, Jews, and Christians Created a Culture of Tolerance in Medieval Spain|first=Maria Rosa|last=Menocal|date=29 November 2009|publisher=Little, Brown|via=Google Books}}</ref>

According to Firas Alkhateeb: "When one reads Imam al-Ghazali’s works at a very superficial level, one can easily misunderstand what he is saying as anti-scientific in general. The truth, however, is that al-Ghazali’s only warning to students is to not fully accept all the beliefs and ideas of a scholar simply because of his achievements in mathematics and science. By issuing such a warning, al-Ghazali is in fact protecting the scientific enterprise for future generations by insulating it from being mixed with theoretical philosophy that could eventually dilute science itself to a field based on conjecture and reasoning alone." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://lostislamichistory.com/al-ghazali/|title=Al-Ghazali and the Revival of Islamic Scholarship|date=22 May 2013|publisher=}}</ref>
