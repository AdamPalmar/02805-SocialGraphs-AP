Freeman is particularly known for his work on [[stakeholder theory]] originally published in his 1984 book ''Strategic Management: A Stakeholder Approach''.

Also recently he co-edited standard business textbooks such as ''The Portable MBA'' and the ''Blackwell's Handbook of Strategic Management.'' His latest book, ''Managing for Stakeholders'', was published 2007.

=== Stakeholder theory ===
[[Stakeholder theory]] is a theory of organizational management and [[business ethics]] that addresses morals and values in managing an organization. It was originally detailed by Freeman in the book ''Strategic Management: a Stakeholder Approach'', and identifies and models the groups which are [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s of a [[corporation]], and both describes and recommends methods by which management can give due regard to the interests of those groups. In short, it attempts to address the "Principle of Who or What Really Counts."<ref name="REF 84">{{cite book |title=Strategic Management: a stakeholder approach |last=Freeman |first=R.

In the traditional view of the firm, the [[shareholder]] view, the shareholders or stockholders are the owners of the company, and the firm has a binding [[fiduciary]] duty to put their needs first, to increase value for them. However, stakeholder theory argues that there are other parties involved, including [[Government agency|governmental bodies]], [[political group]]s, [[trade association]]s, [[trade unions]], [[community|communities]], [[financier]]s, suppliers, [[employee]]s, and [[customer]]s. Sometimes even competitors are counted as stakeholders - their status being derived from their capacity to affect the firm and its other morally legitimate stakeholders. The nature of what is a stakeholder is highly contested (Miles, 2012),<ref>{{cite journal|last=Miles|first=Samantha|title=Stakeholders: essentially contested or just confused?|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|year=2012|volume=108|issue=3|pages=285–298|doi=10.1007/s10551-011-1090-8}}</ref> with several definitions existing in the academic literature (Miles, 2011).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Miles|first=Samantha|title=Stakeholder Definitions: Profusion and Confusion|journal=EIASM 1st interdisciplinary conference on stakeholder, resources and value creation, IESE Business School, University of Navarra, Barcelona|year=2011}}</ref>

=== Corporate social responsibility ===
[[Corporate social responsibility]] (CSR) <ref>D Wood, 'Corporate Social Performance Revisited' (1991) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/258977 16(4) The Academy of Management Review]</ref> is a form of [[corporate]] [[Industry self-regulation|self-regulation]] integrated into a [[business model]]. CSR policy functions as a built-in, self-regulating mechanism whereby a business monitors and ensures its active compliance within the spirit of the law, ethical standards, and international [[norm (sociology)|norm]]s. CSR is a process with the aim to embrace responsibility for the company's actions and encourage a positive impact through its activities on the environment, consumers, employees, communities, [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] and all other members of the [[public sphere]] who may also be considered as stakeholders.

The term "corporate social responsibility" came into common use in the late 1960s and early 1970s after many multinational corporations formed the term [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]], meaning those on whom an organization's activities have an impact. It was used to describe corporate owners beyond [[shareholders]] as a result of an influential book by Freeman, ''Strategic management: a stakeholder approach'' in 1984.<ref name="REF 84"/> Proponents argue that corporations make more long term profits by operating with a perspective, while critics argue that CSR distracts from the economic role of businesses. Others argue CSR is merely [[Display window|window-dressing]], or an attempt to pre-empt the role of governments as a watchdog over powerful [[multinational corporations]]. Anticipation of such concepts appear in a publication that appeared in 1968 <ref>"Integrated structures in the Italian distribution system," Giuffre Editore, Milan, 1968, pp. VIII / 351</ref> by Italian economist Giancarlo Pallavicini, creator of the "Method of the decomposition of the parameters" for the calculation of the results does not directly cost of business, regarding ethical issues, moral, social, cultural and environmental.<ref>"Universal Biographical Encyclopedia" Treccani, 2007 edition, Vol. 14, p. 617; "Treccani - Portal", Social sciences / economics / Biographies; Bancoper Annual Meeting, Bologna, 15.11.2008, Prefect Angelo Tranfaglia, "Profit and Social Responsibility", p. 12; "Finanza e Mercati", 3 February 2009, p. 11, Mara Consoli, "When ethics becomes a bargain"; News Chronicles, CNEL, Rome, 12.01.2009, Adelaide Mochi, "Socialis Awards and Corporate Social Responsibility"</ref>
