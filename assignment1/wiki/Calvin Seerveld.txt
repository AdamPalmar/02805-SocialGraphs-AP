'''Calvin Seerveld''' (born 1930 in [[New York City|New York]]) received a BA from Calvin College in 1952, an MA in English literature and classics from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1953.  He then went on to study under [[D. H. Th. Vollenhoven]] at the [[Vrije Universiteit|Free University]] (VU) in [[Amsterdam]], where his doctoral dissertation dealt with Croce's [[aesthetics]].  It was supervised by Vollenhoven and Carlo Antoni.  He then taught philosophy and German at [[Trinity Christian College]], and went on to teach philosophical aesthetics at the [[Institute for Christian Studies]] in [[Toronto]].

Seerveld has been influential in the [[reformational philosophy|reformational movement]]. In fact he was the first to coin the term 'reformational' to describe the philosophical aspects of neo-Calvinism.  He has taken [[Herman Dooyeweerd|Dooyeweerd's]] aesthetic modal aspect and developed Dooyeweerd's ideas {{Clarify|date=December 2011}}.  His book ''Rainbows for a Fallen World'' has influenced many Christian artists {{according to whom|date=December 2011}}.  In it he argues that "aesthetic obedience is required of everyone by the Lord-artist or not."<sup>2</sup>

Lambert Zuidervaart identifies four claims that constitute Seerveld's contribution to aesthetics<sup>1</sup>:
* The aesthetic is part of the fabric of created reality, and aesthetic norms can be violated or ignored only at great cost.
* The arts, despite their variety and their continuing development, are a unified sphere distinct from other spheres of cultural endeavour, offering opportunities for vocational service to Christians today.
* The aesthetic is not limited only to the arts, just as the arts have many facets other than the aesthetic.
* The core meaning of the aesthetic - and distinguishing characteristic of the arts - is 'allusiveness' or 'imaginativity'.
