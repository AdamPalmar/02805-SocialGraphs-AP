'''Moses Ilyich Schönfinkel''', also known as '''Moisei Isai'evich Sheinfinkel'''' (Russian: Моисей Исаевич Шейнфинкель; 4 September 1889&ndash;1942), was a [[Russians|Russian]] [[logician]] and [[mathematician]], known for the invention of [[combinatory logic]].

== Life ==
Schönfinkel attended the [[Novorossiysk University]] of [[Odessa]], studying mathematics under [[Samuil Osipovich Shatunovskii]] (1859&ndash;1929), who worked in [[geometry]] and the [[foundations of mathematics]]. From 1914 to 1924, Schönfinkel was a member of [[David Hilbert]]'s group at the [[University of Göttingen]].<ref name="CardoneHindley">{{Citation

After he left Göttingen, Schönfinkel returned to Moscow. By 1927 he was reported to be mentally ill and in a sanatorium.<ref name="Archives"/><ref name="Kline"/> His later life was spent in poverty, and he died in Moscow some time in 1942. His papers were burned by his neighbors for heating.<ref name="Kline"/>

== Work ==

Schönfinkel developed a formal system that avoided the use of [[bound variables]]. His system was essentially equivalent to a combinatory logic based upon the combinators '''B''', '''C''', '''I''', '''K''', and '''S'''. Schönfinkel was able to show that the system could be reduced to just '''K''' and '''S''' and outlined a proof that a version of this system had the same power as [[predicate logic]].<ref name="Archives"/>

His paper also showed that functions of two or more arguments could be replaced by functions taking a single argument.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Christopher|last=Strachey|authorlink=Christopher Strachey|title=Fundamental Concepts in Programming Languages|journal=[[Higher-Order and Symbolic Computation]]|volume=13|pages=11–49|year=2000|quote=There is a device originated by Schönfinkel, for reducing operators with several operands to the successive application of single operand operators.|doi=10.1023/A:1010000313106|ref=harv}} (Reprinted lecture notes from 1967.)</ref><ref>{{cite journal|first=John C.|last=Reynolds|authorlink=John C.
