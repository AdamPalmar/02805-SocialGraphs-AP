A native of the Kingdom of France, he spent about 20 years (1629–49) of his life in the [[Dutch Republic]] after serving for a while in the [[Dutch States Army]] of [[Maurice of Nassau]], [[Prince of Orange]] and the [[Stadtholder]] of the [[United Provinces of the Netherlands|United Provinces]]. He is generally considered one of the most notable intellectual representatives of the [[Dutch Golden Age]].<ref>Nadler, Steven: ''The Philosopher, the Priest, and the Painter: A Portrait of Descartes''. (Princeton University Press, 2015, {{ISBN|9780691165752}})</ref>

Descartes's ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' continues to be a standard text at most university philosophy departments. Descartes's influence in mathematics is equally apparent; the [[Cartesian coordinate system]] (see [[#Mathematical legacy|below]]) was named after him. He is credited as the father of [[analytical geometry]], the bridge between algebra and geometry, used in the discovery of [[infinitesimal calculus]] and [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]]. Descartes was also one of the key figures in the [[scientific revolution]].

Descartes refused to accept the authority of previous philosophers. He frequently set his views apart from those of his predecessors. In the opening section of the ''[[Passions of the Soul|Les passions de l'âme]]'', a treatise on the [[Early modern period|early modern]] version of what are now commonly called [[emotion]]s, Descartes goes so far as to assert that he will write on this topic "as if no one had written on these matters before". His best known philosophical statement is "''[[Cogito ergo sum]]''" ({{lang-fr|link=no|Je pense, donc je suis}}; ''I think, therefore I am''), found in part IV of ''[[Discourse on the Method|Discours de la méthode]]'' (1637; written in French but with inclusion of "''Cogito ergo sum''") and §7 of part I of ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]'' (1644; written in Latin).<ref>This idea had already been proposed by the Spanish philosopher [[Gómez Pereira]] a hundred years ago in the form: "I know I know something. Everything that knows is: thus I am" (''Nosco me aliquid noscere: at quidquid noscit, est: ergo ego sum''). See: Gómez Pereira, ''De Inmortalitate Animae'', 1749 [1554], p. 277; Santos López, Modesto (1986). "Gómez Pereira, médico y filósofo medinense". In: ''Historia de Medina del Campo y su Tierra, volumen I: Nacimiento y expansión'', ed. by Eufemio Lorenzo Sanz, 1986.</ref>

Many elements of his philosophy have precedents in late [[Aristotelianism]], the [[Neostoicism|revived Stoicism]] of the 16th century, or in earlier philosophers like [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]. In his [[natural philosophy]], he differed from the [[Scholasticism|schools]] on two major points: first, he rejected the splitting of [[corporeal substance]] into matter and form; second, he rejected any appeal to [[Teleology|final ends]], divine or natural, in explaining natural phenomena.<ref>{{cite book |last=Carlson |first=Neil R. |title=Physiology of Behavior |publisher=Pearson: Allyn & Bacon |year=2001 |location=Needham Heights, Massachusetts |page=8 |url= |id= |isbn=0-205-30840-6 }}</ref> In his theology, he insists on the absolute freedom of God's act of creation.

Descartes laid the foundation for 17th-century continental [[rationalism]], later advocated by [[Baruch Spinoza]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]], and opposed by the [[empiricist]] school of thought consisting of [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], and [[David Hume|Hume]]. Leibniz, Spinoza<ref>R. H. Moorman, [http://www.faculty.umb.edu/gary_zabel/Courses/Spinoza/Texts/The%20Influence%20of%20Mathematics%20on%20the%20Philosophy%20of%20Spinoza.pdf "The Influence of Mathematics on the Philosophy of Spinoza"], ''National Mathematics Magazine'', Vol. 18, No. 3.

===Early life===

[[File:DescartesGraduationRegistry.JPG|thumb|Graduation registry for Descartes at the [[University of Poitiers]], 1616]]

Descartes was born in La Haye en Touraine (now [[Descartes, Indre-et-Loire|Descartes]], [[Indre-et-Loire]]<!--Indre-et-Loire did not exist before 1790-->), France, on 31 March 1596. When he was one year old, his mother Jeanne Brochard died after trying to give birth to another child who also died. His father Joachim was a member of the [[Parlement of Brittany]] at [[Rennes]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Rodis-Lewis |first=Geneviève |chapter=Descartes' life and the development of his philosophy |editor-last=Cottingham |editor-first=John |editor-link=John Cottingham |title=The Cambridge Companion to Descartes |year=1992 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-36696-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Prhr9FBdQ_MC |page=22}}</ref> René lived with his grandmother and with his great-uncle. Although the Descartes family was Roman Catholic, the Poitou region was controlled by the Protestant Huguenots.<ref>[http://all-history.org/world_literature/descartes1.htm All-history.org]</ref> In 1607, late because of his fragile health, he entered the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Prytanée National Militaire|Collège Royal Henry-Le-Grand]] at [[La Flèche]],<ref>Clarke (2006), p. 24</ref> where he was introduced to mathematics and physics, including Galileo's work.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Porter |first1=Roy |authorlink=Roy Porter |title=The Greatest Benefit to Mankind: A Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present |edition=paperback edition, 135798642 |year=1999 |origyear=1997 |publisher=Harper Collins |location=Great Britain |isbn=0006374549 |page=217 |chapter=The New Science}}</ref> After graduation in 1614, he studied two years (1615–16) at the [[University of Poitiers]], earning a ''[[Baccalauréat]]'' and ''[[Licence (France)|Licence]]'' in [[Canon Law|Canon]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|Civil Law]], in accordance with his father's wishes that he should become a lawyer.<ref>{{cite book |last2=Kaufmann |first2=Walter |last=Baird |first=Forrest E. |title=From Plato to Derrida |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |year=2008 |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey |pages=373–377 |url= |id= |isbn=0-13-158591-6 }}</ref> From there he moved to Paris.

In his book ''Discourse on the Method'', Descartes recalls,
<blockquote>I entirely abandoned the study of letters. Resolving to seek no knowledge other than that of which could be found in myself or else in the great book of the world, I spent the rest of my youth traveling, visiting courts and armies, mixing with people of diverse temperaments and ranks, gathering various experiences, testing myself in the situations which fortune offered me, and at all times reflecting upon whatever came my way so as to derive some profit from it.</blockquote>

Given his ambition to become a professional military officer, in 1618, Descartes joined, as a [[mercenary]], the [[Protestant]] [[Dutch States Army]] in Breda under the command of [[Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange|Maurice of Nassau]], and undertook a formal study of [[military engineering]], as established by [[Simon Stevin]]. Descartes, therefore, received much encouragement in Breda to advance his knowledge of mathematics. In this way, he became acquainted with [[Isaac Beeckman]], principal of a [[Dordrecht]] school, for whom he wrote the Compendium of Music (written 1618, published 1650). Together they worked on [[free fall]], [[catenary]], [[conic section]], and [[fluid statics]]. Both believed that it was necessary to create a method that thoroughly linked mathematics and physics.<ref name="Durandin">Guy Durandin, Les Principes de la Philosophie.

===Visions===
According to [[Adrien Baillet]], on the night of 10–11 November 1619 ([[St. Martin's Day]]), while stationed in [[Neuburg an der Donau]], Descartes shut himself in a room with an "oven" (probably a ''Kachelofen'' or [[masonry heater]]) to escape the cold. While within, he had three visions and believed that a divine spirit revealed to him a new philosophy. Upon exiting, he had formulated [[analytical geometry]] and the idea of applying the mathematical method to philosophy. He concluded from these visions that the pursuit of science would prove to be, for him, the pursuit of true wisdom and a central part of his life's work.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Durant |first1=Will |authorlink1=Will Durant |last2=Durant |first2=Ariel |authorlink2=Ariel Durant |title=[[The Story of Civilization: Part VII, the Age of Reason Begins]] |year=1961 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |location=New York |isbn=0-671-01320-3 |page=637}}</ref><ref>Clarke (2006), pp. 58–59.</ref>  Descartes also saw very clearly that all truths were linked with one another so that finding a fundamental truth and proceeding with logic would open the way to all science. Descartes discovered this basic truth quite soon: his famous "[[I think, therefore I am]]".<ref name="Durandin"/>

===France===
In 1620 Descartes left the army. He visited [[Basilica della Santa Casa]] in Loreto, then visited various countries before returning to France, and during the next few years spent time in Paris. It was there that he composed his first essay on method: ''Regulae ad Directionem Ingenii'' ([[Rules for the Direction of the Mind]]).<ref name="Durandin"/> He arrived in [[The Hague|La Haye]] in 1623, selling all of his property to invest in [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], which provided a comfortable income for the rest of his life.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Descartes was present at the [[siege of La Rochelle]] by [[Armand Jean du Plessis, Cardinal Richelieu|Cardinal Richelieu]] in 1627.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} In the fall of the same year, in the residence of the papal nuncio [[Giovanni Francesco Guidi di Bagno|Guidi di Bagno]], where he came with [[Marin Mersenne|Mersenne]] and many other scholars to listen to a lecture given by the alchemist Nicolas de Villiers, Sieur de Chandoux on the principles of a supposed new philosophy,<ref>Nicolas de Villiers, Sieur de Chandoux, ''Lettres sur l'or potable suivies du traité De la connaissance des vrais principes de la nature et des mélanges et de fragments d'un Commentaire sur l'Amphithéâtre de la Sapience éternelle de Khunrath'', Textes édités et présentés par Sylvain Matton avec des études de Xavier Kieft et de Simone Mazauric.

===Netherlands===
[[File:Westermarkt 6, Descarteshuis (links).JPG|thumb|In [[Amsterdam]], Descartes lived on Westermarkt 6 (Descarteshuis, on the left).]]

Descartes returned to the Dutch Republic in 1628. In April 1629 he joined the [[University of Franeker]], studying under [[Adriaan Metius]], living either with a Catholic family, or renting the [[Sjaerdemaslot]], where he invited in vain a French cook and an optician.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The next year, under the name "Poitevin", he enrolled at the [[Leiden University]] to study mathematics with [[Jacobus Golius]], who confronted him with [[Pappus's hexagon theorem]], and [[astronomy]] with [[Martin van den Hove|Martin Hortensius]].<ref>[[A.C. Grayling]], ''Descartes: The Life of René Descartes and Its Place in His Times'', Simon and Schuster, 2006, pp. 151–152</ref> In October 1630 he had a falling-out with Beeckman, whom he accused of plagiarizing some of his ideas. In Amsterdam, he had a relationship with a servant girl, Helena Jans van der Strom, with whom he had a daughter, [[Francine Descartes|Francine]], who was born in 1635 in [[Deventer]].

<!--Francine Descartes died in 1640 in [[Amersfoort]], from [[Scarlet Fever]].-->
Unlike many moralists of the time, Descartes was not devoid of passions but rather defended them; he wept upon Francine's death in 1640.<ref>{{cite book |last=Durant |first=Will and Ariel |title=The Story of Civilization: Par VII, the Age of reason Begins |year=1961 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |location=New York |isbn=0-671-01320-3 |page=638}}</ref> "Descartes said that he did not believe that one must refrain from tears to prove oneself a man."

Despite frequent moves,<ref>While in the Netherlands he changed his address frequently, living among other places in Dordrecht (1628), [[Franeker]] (1629), Amsterdam (1629–30), [[Leiden]] (1630), Amsterdam (1630–32), Deventer (1632–34), Amsterdam (1634–35), [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] (1635–36), Leiden (1636), [[Egmond aan den Hoef|Egmond]] (1636–38), [[Santpoort]] (1638–1640), Leiden (1640–41), Endegeest (a castle near [[Oegstgeest]]) (1641–43), and finally for an extended time in [[Egmond-Binnen]] (1643–49).</ref> he wrote all his major work during his 20+ years in the Netherlands, where he managed to revolutionize mathematics and philosophy.<ref>He had lived with [[Henricus Reneri]] in Deventer and Amsterdam, and had met with [[Constantijn Huygens]] and Vopiscus Fortunatus Plempius; Descartes was interviewed by Frans Burman at Egmond-Binnen in 1648. [[Henricus Regius]], [[Jan Jansz de Jonge Stampioen|Jan Stampioen]], [[Frans van Schooten]], [[Comenius]] and [[Gisbertus Voetius]] were his main opponents.</ref> In 1633, [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] was condemned by the [[Catholic Church]], and Descartes abandoned plans to publish ''[[The World (Descartes)|Treatise on the World]]'', his work of the previous four years. Nevertheless, in 1637 he published part of this work in three essays: ''Les Météores'' (The Meteors), ''[[Dioptrique|La Dioptrique]]'' (Dioptrics) and ''La Géométrie'' (Geometry), preceded by an introduction, his famous ''Discours de la méthode'' (Discourse on the Method). In it, Descartes lays out four rules of thought, meant to ensure that our knowledge rests upon a firm foundation.

{{Quote|The first was never to accept anything for true which I did not clearly know to be such; that is to say, carefully to avoid precipitancy and prejudice, and to comprise nothing more in my judgment than what was presented to my mind so clearly and distinctly as to exclude all ground of doubt.}}

[[File:René Descartes 1644 Principia philosophiae.jpg|thumb|''Principia philosophiae'', 1644]]

Descartes continued to publish works concerning both mathematics and philosophy for the rest of his life. In 1641 he published a metaphysics work, ''Meditationes de Prima Philosophia'' (Meditations on First Philosophy), written in Latin and thus addressed to the learned. It was followed, in 1644, by ''Principia Philosophiæ'' (Principles of Philosophy), a kind of synthesis of the ''Discourse on the Method'' and ''Meditations on First Philosophy''. In 1643, Cartesian philosophy was condemned at the University of Utrecht, and Descartes was obliged to flee to the Hague, but settled in [[Egmond-Binnen]], where he married his servant Helena (see above) the daughter of the innkeeper.

Descartes began (through Alfonso Polloti, an Italian general in Dutch service) a long correspondence with [[Elisabeth of the Palatinate|Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia]], devoted mainly to moral and psychological subjects. Connected with this correspondence, in 1649 he published ''Les Passions de l'âme'' (Passions of the Soul), that he dedicated to the Princess. In 1647, he was awarded a pension by the [[Louis XIV of France]], though it was never paid.<ref name="Descartes, René 2009">Descartes, René. (2009). Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica 2009 Deluxe Edition. Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica.</ref> A French translation of ''Principia Philosophiæ'', prepared by Abbot Claude Picot, was published in 1647. This edition Descartes also dedicated to Princess Elisabeth. In [[Principles of Philosophy#Preface to the French edition|the preface to the French edition]], Descartes praised true philosophy as a means to attain wisdom. He identifies four ordinary sources to reach wisdom and finally says that there is a fifth, better and more secure, consisting in the search for first causes.<ref>Blom, John J., Descartes.

===Sweden===

[[File:Vasterlanggatan 68 portal March 2007.JPG|thumb|The rear of the "von der Lindeska huset" on Västerlånggatan 68]]

[[Christina, Queen of Sweden|Queen Christina of Sweden]] invited Descartes to her court in 1649 to organize a new scientific academy and tutor her in his ideas about love. She was interested in and stimulated Descartes to publish the "[[Passions of the Soul]]", a work based on his correspondence with Princess Elisabeth.<ref name="Smith">{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Kurt |title=Descartes' Life and Works |work=[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |date=Fall 2010 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-works/}}</ref>

He was a guest at the house of [[Pierre Chanut]], living on [[Västerlånggatan]], less than 500 meters from [[Tre Kronor (castle)|Tre Kronor]] in [[Stockholm]]. There, Chanut and Descartes made observations with a [[Evangelista Torricelli|Torricellian]] barometer, a tube with [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. Challenging [[Blaise Pascal]], Descartes took the first set of barometric readings in Stockholm to see if [[atmospheric pressure]] could be used in forecasting the weather.<ref>[http://www.islandnet.com/~see/weather/almanac/arc2009/alm09jun.htm Islandnet.com]</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/stream/modernmeteorolog00mete/modernmeteorolog00mete_djvu.txt Archive.org]</ref>

===Death===

Descartes apparently started giving lessons to Queen Christina after her birthday, three times a week, at 5 a.m, in her cold and draughty castle. Soon it became clear they did not like each other; she did not like his [[Mechanical philosophy#Descartes and the mechanical philosophy|mechanical philosophy]], nor did he appreciate her interest in [[Ancient Greek]]. <!--Mid January Christina left the city for three weeks.--> By 15 January 1650, Descartes had seen Christina only four or five times. On 1 February he caught a cold which quickly turned into a serious respiratory infection, and he died on 11 February. The cause of death was [[pneumonia]] according to Chanut, but [[pleurisy|peripneumonia]] according to the doctor Van Wullen who was not allowed to bleed him.<ref>[http://rue89.nouvelobs.com/2010/02/12/il-y-a-des-preuves-que-rene-descartes-a-ete-assassine-138138 Rue89.nouvelobs.com]</ref> (The winter seems to have been mild,<ref>[http://www.int-res.com/articles/cr/17/c017p055.pdf Severity of winter seasons in the northern Baltic Sea between 1529 and 1990: reconstruction and analysis by S.

==Philosophical work==
{{Further information|Cartesianism}}

Descartes is often regarded as the first thinker to emphasize the use of reason to develop the [[natural sciences]].<ref>

In his ''Discourse on the Method'', he attempts to arrive at a fundamental set of principles that one can know as true without any doubt. To achieve this, he employs a method called hyperbolical/metaphysical doubt, also sometimes referred to as [[methodological skepticism]]: he rejects any ideas that can be doubted and then reestablishes them in order to acquire a firm foundation for genuine knowledge.<ref>{{cite web |first=Rebecca |last=Copenhaver |title=Forms of skepticism |url=http://www.lclark.edu/~rebeccac/forms.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050108095032/http://www.lclark.edu/~rebeccac/forms.html |archivedate=8 January 2005 |accessdate=15 August 2007}}</ref>

Descartes built his ideas from scratch. He relates this to architecture: the top soil is taken away to create a new building or structure. Descartes calls his doubt the soil and new knowledge the buildings. To Descartes, Aristotle’s foundationalism is incomplete and his method of doubt enhances foundationalism.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/descartes-epistemology/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Newman|first=Lex|date=2016-01-01|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2016}}</ref>

[[File:Descartes3.jpg|thumb|left|René Descartes at work]]

Initially, Descartes arrives at only a single principle: thought exists. Thought cannot be separated from me, therefore, I exist (''Discourse on the Method'' and ''Principles of Philosophy''). Most famously, this is known as ''cogito ergo sum'' (English: "I think, therefore I am"). Therefore, Descartes concluded, if he doubted, then something or someone must be doing the doubting, therefore the very fact that he doubted proved his existence. "The simple meaning of the phrase is that if one is skeptical of existence, that is in and of itself proof that he does exist."<ref>{{cite web|title=Ten books: Chosen by Raj Persuade|publisher=The [[British Journal of Psychiatry]]|url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/full/181/3/258}}</ref>

Descartes concludes that he can be certain that he exists because he thinks. But in what form? He perceives his body through the use of the senses; however, these have previously been unreliable. So Descartes determines that the only indubitable knowledge is that he is a ''thinking thing''. Thinking is what he does, and his power must come from his essence. Descartes defines "thought" (''cogitatio'') as "what happens in me such that I am immediately conscious of it, insofar as I am conscious of it". Thinking is thus every activity of a person of which the person is immediately [[Consciousness|conscious]].<ref>{{cite book |first=René |last=Descartes |year=1644 |title=The Principles of Philosophy (IX)}}</ref>

To further demonstrate the limitations of these senses, Descartes proceeds with what is known as the ''[[Wax Argument]]''. Descartes concludes that his senses are similar to wax. Wax changes its characteristics when exposed to flame, but it is still the same. He compares himself to this wax and rejects his senses and considers his mind the only thing he can trust. It is the never-changing characteristics.

Therefore, to properly grasp the nature of the wax, he should put aside the senses. He must use his mind. Descartes concludes:
{{quote|And so something that I thought I was seeing with my eyes is in fact grasped solely by the faculty of judgment which is in my mind.}}

In this manner, Descartes proceeds to construct a system of knowledge, discarding [[perception]] as unreliable and, instead, admitting only [[deductive reasoning|deduction]] as a method. In the third and fifth ''Meditation'', he offers an [[ontological proof]] of a benevolent God (through both the [[ontological argument]] and [[trademark argument]]). Because God is benevolent, he can have some faith in the account of reality his senses provide him, for God has provided him with a working mind and [[sensory system]] and does not desire to deceive him. From this supposition, however, he finally establishes the possibility of acquiring knowledge about the world based on deduction ''and'' perception. Regarding [[epistemology]], therefore, he can be said to have contributed such ideas as a rigorous conception of [[foundationalism]] and the possibility that [[reason]] is the only reliable method of attaining knowledge. He, nevertheless, was very much aware that experimentation was necessary to verify and validate theories.<ref name="Preface"/>

Descartes also wrote a response to [[External world scepticism]]. Through this method of scepticism, he does not doubt for the sake of doubting but to achieve concrete and reliable information. In other words, certainty. He argues that [[sensory perception]]s come to him involuntarily, and are not willed by him. They are external to his senses, and according to Descartes, this is evidence of the existence of something outside of his mind, and thus, an external world. Descartes goes on to show that the things in the external world are material by arguing that God would not deceive him as to the ideas that are being transmitted, and that God has given him the "propensity" to believe that such ideas are caused by material things. Descartes also believes a substance is something that does not need any assistance to function or exist. Descartes further explains how only God can be a true “substance”. But minds are substances, meaning they need only God for it to function. The mind is a thinking substance. The means for a thinking substance stem from ideas.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/descarte/|title=Descartes, Rene {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-22}}</ref>

He gave reasons for thinking that waking thoughts are distinguishable from [[dream argument|dreams]], and that one's mind cannot have been "hijacked" by an [[evil demon]] placing an illusory external world before one's senses. The Evil Genius Doubt that arises from doubting simple concepts like basic mathematics and geometry. The Evil Genius or evil demon doubt is an external force who is capable of deception.<ref name=":0" />

=== Three types of ideas ===
There are three kinds of ideas, explained Descartes, Fabricated, Innate and Adventitious. Fabricated ideas are inventions made by the mind. For example, a person has never eaten moose but assumes it tastes like cow. Adventitious ideas are ideas that cannot be manipulated or changed by the mind. For example, a person stands in a cold room, they can only think of the feeling as cold and nothing else.  Innate ideas are set ideas made by God in a person’s mind. For example, The features of a shape can be examined and set aside, but its content can never be manipulated to cause it not to be a three sided object.<ref name=":1" />

===Dualism===
{{Further information|Mind-body dichotomy|dualism}}
[[File:L'homme V00083 00000004.tif|thumb|''L'homme'' (1664)]]

Descartes, influenced by the Automatons on display throughout the city of Paris, began to investigate the connection between the mind and body.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://people.whitman.edu/~herbrawt/classes/339/Descartes.pdf|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> The main influences for Dualism were theology and physics<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/20013943?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> and how the two interact. Descartes in his ''Passions of the Soul'' and ''[[The Description of the Human Body]]'' suggested that the body works like a machine, that it has material properties. The [[mind]] (or [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]), on the other hand, was described as a [[mental world|nonmaterial]] and does not follow the laws of nature. Descartes argued that the mind interacts with the body at the [[pineal gland]]. This form of [[dualism]] or duality proposes that the mind controls the body, but that the body can also influence the otherwise rational mind, such as when people act out of passion. Most of the previous accounts of the relationship between mind and body had been uni-directional.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Descartes suggested that the pineal gland is "the seat of the soul" for several reasons. First, the soul is unitary, and unlike many areas of the brain the pineal gland appeared to be unitary (though subsequent microscopic inspection has revealed it is formed of two hemispheres). Second, Descartes observed that the pineal gland was located near the [[ventricular system|ventricles]]. He believed the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] of the ventricles acted through the nerves to control the body, and that the pineal gland influenced this process. Sensations delivered by the nerves to the pineal, he believed, caused it to vibrate in some sympathetic manner, which in turn gave rise to the emotions and caused the body to act.<ref name="Descartes, René 2009"/> Cartesian dualism set the agenda for philosophical discussion of the [[mind–body problem]] for many years after Descartes' death.<ref>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (online): Descartes and the Pineal Gland.</ref>

Descartes denied that animals had reason or intelligence, but did not lack sensations or perceptions, but these could be explained mechanistically.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Animal Consciousness'', No. 2. Historical background| publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|date=23 December 1995|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-animal/#hist|accessdate=16 December 2014}}</ref> Descartes argued the theory of Innate knowledge and that all humans were born with knowledge through a higher power (religion). It was this theory of Innate knowledge that later led philosopher John Locke (1632-1704) to combat this theory of empiricism (that all knowledge is acquired through experience).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/27532614|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>

===Descartes' moral philosophy===
For Descartes, ethics was a science, the highest and most perfect of them. Like the rest of the sciences, ethics had its roots in metaphysics.<ref name="Preface"/> In this way, he argues for the existence of God, investigates the place of man in nature, formulates the theory of mind-body dualism, and defends [[free will]]. However, as he was a convinced rationalist, Descartes clearly states that reason is sufficient in the search for the goods that we should seek, and [[virtue]] consists in the correct reasoning that should guide our actions. Nevertheless, the quality of this reasoning depends on knowledge, because a well-informed mind will be more capable of making good choices, and it also depends on mental condition. For this reason, he said that a complete moral philosophy should include the study of the body. He discussed this subject in the correspondence with [[Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia]], and as a result wrote his work ''The Passions of the Soul'', that contains a study of the [[psychosomatic]] processes and reactions in man, with an emphasis on emotions or passions.<ref name="Blom">Blom, John J., Descartes. His moral philosophy and psychology. New York University Press. 1978. {{isbn|0-8147-0999-0}}</ref>

Humans should seek the [[summum bonum|sovereign good]] that Descartes, following [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]], identifies with virtue, as this produces a solid blessedness or pleasure. For [[Epicurus]] the sovereign good was pleasure, and Descartes says that, in fact, this is not in contradiction with Zeno's teaching, because virtue produces a spiritual pleasure, that is better than bodily pleasure. Regarding [[Aristotle]]'s opinion that happiness depends on the goods of fortune, Descartes does not deny that this good contributes to happiness but remarks that they are in great proportion outside one's own control, whereas one's mind is under one's complete control.<ref name="Blom"/>

The moral writings of Descartes came at the last part of his life, but earlier, in his ''Discourse on the Method'' he adopted three maxims to be able to act while he put all his ideas into doubt. This is known as his [[Discourse on the Method#Part III: Morals, and Maxims accepted while conducting Method|"Provisional Morals"]].

===Religious beliefs===
In his ''Meditations on First Philosophy'' Descartes sets forth two proofs for God's existence. One of these is founded upon the possibility of thinking the "idea of a being that is supremely perfect and infinite," and suggests that "of all the ideas that are in me, the idea that I have of God is the most true, the most clear and distinct."<ref>Descartes, Rene "Meditations on First Philosophy, 3rd Ed., Translated from Latin by: Donald A. Cress</ref>  Descartes considered himself to be a devout Catholic<ref name="books.google.be" /><ref name="KrR-5EKLSQMC p. 207" /><ref name="Gh_BAAAQBAJ p. 107" /> and one of the purposes of the ''Meditations'' was to defend the Catholic faith. His attempt to ground theological beliefs on reason encountered intense opposition in his time, however: [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] regarded Descartes' views as rationalist and mechanist, and accused him of [[deism]]: "I cannot forgive Descartes; in all his philosophy, Descartes did his best to dispense with God. But Descartes could not avoid prodding God to set the world in motion with a snap of his lordly fingers; after that, he had no more use for God," while a powerful contemporary, [[Martin Schoock]], accused him of [[atheist]] beliefs, though Descartes had provided an explicit critique of atheism in his ''Meditations''. The Catholic Church prohibited his books in 1663.<ref name="Descartes, René 2009"/><ref>Edward C. Mendler, ''False Truths: The Error of Relying on Authority, p. 16</ref>

==Historical impact==
===Emancipation from Church doctrine===
[[File:DescartesMeditations.png|thumb|Cover of ''Meditations'']]

Descartes has often been dubbed the father of modern Western philosophy, the thinker whose approach has profoundly changed the course of Western philosophy and set the basis for [[modernity]].<ref name="Russell2004p516">[[Bertrand Russell]] (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ey94E3sOMA0C&pg=PA516 ''History of western philosophy''] pp.511, 516–7</ref><ref>Heidegger [1938] (2002), p. 76 quotation: {{quote|Descartes... that which he himself founded... modern (and that means, at the same time, Western) metaphysics.}}</ref> The first two of his ''Meditations on First Philosophy'', those that formulate the famous [[methodic doubt]], represent the portion of Descartes' writings that most influenced modern thinking.<ref>[[Tad Schmaltz|Schmaltz, Tad M.]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=pIYcUBCOrNgC&pg=PA27 ''Radical Cartesianism: The French Reception of Descartes''] p.27 quotation: {{quote|The Descartes most familiar to twentieth-century philosophers is the Descartes of the first two ''Meditations'', someone proccupied with hyperbolic doubt of the material world and the certainty of knowledge of the self that emerges from the famous cogito argument.}}</ref> It has been argued that Descartes himself didn't realize the extent of this revolutionary move.<ref>[[Roy Wood Sellars]] (1949) [https://books.google.com/books?id=y1wNAAAAIAAJ ''Philosophy for the future: the quest of modern materialism''] quotation: {{quote|Husserl has taken Descartes very seriously in a historical as well as in a systematic sense [...] [in ''The Crisis of the European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology'', Husserl] finds in the first two Meditations of Descartes a depth which it is difficult to fathom, and which Descartes himself was so little able to appreciate that he let go "the great discovery" he had in his hands.}}</ref> In shifting the debate from "what is true" to "of what can I be certain?," Descartes arguably shifted the authoritative guarantor of truth from God to humanity (even though Descartes himself claimed he received his visions from God) – while the traditional concept of "truth" implies an external authority, "certainty" instead relies on the judgment of the individual.

In an [[anthropocentric]] revolution, the human being is now raised to the level of a subject, an agent, an [[emancipated]] being equipped with autonomous reason. This was a revolutionary step that established the basis of modernity, the repercussions of which are still being felt: the emancipation of humanity from Christian [[revelation]]al truth and [[Catholic Church|Church doctrine]]; humanity making its own law and taking its own stand.<ref name="Heidegger1938emancipated">Martin Heidegger [1938] (2002) ''The Age of the World Picture'' quotation: {{quote|For up to Descartes...a particular ''sub-iectum''...lies at the foundation of its own fixed qualities and changing circumstances. The superiority of a ''sub-iectum''...arises out of the claim of man to a...self-supported, unshakeable foundation of truth, in the sense of certainty.

This anthropocentric perspective of Descartes' work, establishing human reason as autonomous, provided the basis for the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]'s emancipation from God and the Church. It also provided the basis for all subsequent [[anthropology]].<ref name="Heidegger19382002p75">Heidegger [1938] (2002), p. 75 quotation: {{quote|With the interpretation of man as ''subiectum'', Descartes creates the metaphysical presupposition for future anthropology of every kind and tendency.}}</ref> Descartes' philosophical revolution is sometimes said to have sparked modern [[anthropocentrism]] and [[subjectivism]].<ref name="Russell2004p516"/><ref>Benjamin Isadore Schwart [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wt4XDLEpjWYC&pg=PA95 ''China and Other Matters''] p.95 quotation: {{quote|...&nbsp;the kind of anthropocentric subjectivism which has emerged from the Cartesian revolution.}}</ref><ref>[[Charles B.

Descartes work has been used, in fact to inaugurates an entirely new kind of philosophy.

===Mathematical legacy===
[[File:Cartesian coordinates 2D.svg|thumb|A Cartesian coordinates graph, using his invented ''x'' and ''y'' axes.]]

One of Descartes' most enduring legacies was his development of [[Cartesian geometry|Cartesian or analytic geometry]], which uses algebra to describe geometry. He "invented the convention of representing unknowns in equations by ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'', and knowns by ''a'', ''b'', and ''c''". He also "pioneered the standard notation" that uses [[superscript]]s to show the powers or exponents; for example, the 4 used in x<sup>4</sup> to indicate squaring of squaring.<ref>René Descartes, ''Discourse de la Méthode'' (Leiden, Netherlands): Jan Maire, 1637, appended book: ''La Géométrie'', book one, [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b86069594/f383.image page 299.] From page 299: ''" ... Et ''aa'', ou ''a''<sup>2</sup>, pour multiplier ''a'' par soy mesme; Et ''a''<sup>3</sup>, pour le multiplier encore une fois par ''a'', & ainsi a l'infini ; ... "'' ( ... and ''aa'', or ''a''<sup>2</sup>, in order to multiply ''a'' by itself; and ''a''<sup>3</sup>, in order to multiply it once more by ''a'', and thus to infinity ; ... )</ref><ref>Tom Sorell, ''Descartes: A Very Short Introduction'' (2000). New York: Oxford University Press. p. 19.</ref> He was first to assign a fundamental place for algebra in our system of knowledge, using it as a method to automate or mechanize reasoning, particularly about abstract, unknown quantities. European mathematicians had previously viewed geometry as a more fundamental form of mathematics, serving as the foundation of algebra. Algebraic rules were given geometric proofs by mathematicians such as [[Luca Pacioli|Pacioli]], [[Gerolamo Cardano|Cardan]], [[Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia|Tartaglia]] and [[Lodovico Ferrari|Ferrari]]. Equations of [[Degree of a polynomial|degree]] higher than the third were regarded as unreal, because a three-dimensional form, such as a cube, occupied the largest dimension of reality. Descartes professed that the abstract quantity ''a<sup>2</sup>'' could represent length as well as an area. This was in opposition to the teachings of mathematicians, such as [[François Viète|Vieta]], who argued that it could represent only area. Although Descartes did not pursue the subject, he preceded [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] in envisioning a more general science of algebra or "universal mathematics," as a precursor to [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], that could encompass logical principles and methods symbolically, and mechanize general reasoning.<ref>[[Morris Kline]], ''Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times'' (1972). New York: Oxford University Press. pp. 280–281</ref>

Descartes' work provided the basis for the [[calculus]] developed by [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and Leibniz, who applied infinitesimal calculus to the [[Tangent#Analytical approach|tangent line problem]], thus permitting the evolution of that branch of modern mathematics.<ref>{{cite book |first=Jan |last=Gullberg |authorlink=Jan Gullberg |year=1997 |title=Mathematics From The Birth of Numbers |publisher=W. W. Norton |isbn=0-393-04002-X}}</ref> His [[Descartes' rule of signs|rule of signs]] is also a commonly used method to determine the number of positive and negative roots of a polynomial.

Descartes discovered an early form of the law of conservation of mechanical [[momentum]] (a measure of the motion of an object), and envisioned it as pertaining to motion in a straight line, as opposed to perfect circular motion, as [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] had envisioned it. He outlined his views on the universe in his ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]''.

Descartes also made contributions to the field of [[optics]]. He showed by using geometric construction and the [[law of refraction]] (also known as Descartes' law or more commonly [[Snell's law]]) that the angular radius of a [[rainbow]] is 42 degrees (i.e., the angle subtended at the eye by the edge of the rainbow and the ray passing from the sun through the rainbow's centre is 42°).<ref>{{cite book |last=Tipler |first=P. A. and G. Mosca |year=2004 |title=Physics For Scientists And Engineers |publisher=W. H. Freeman |isbn=0-7167-4389-2}}</ref> He also independently discovered the [[law of reflection]], and his essay on optics was the first published mention of this law.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|year=2008 |encyclopedia=Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761555262/Rene_Descartes.html#s3 |title=René Descartes |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=15 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070907142158/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761555262/Rene_Descartes.html |archivedate=7 September 2007 |df= }}</ref>

===Influence on Newton's mathematics===
Current opinion is that Descartes had the most influence of anyone on the young Newton, and this is arguably one of Descartes' most important contributions. Newton continued Descartes' work on cubic equations, which freed the subject from the fetters of the Greek perspectives. The most important concept was his very modern treatment of independent variables.<ref>''Contemporary Newtonian Research'', edited by Z. Bechler, p. 109-129, ''Newton the Mathematician'', by Daniel T. Whiteside, Springer, 1982.</ref>

===Contemporary reception===
Although Descartes was well known in academic circles towards the end of his life, the teaching of his works in schools was controversial. Henri de Roy ([[Henricus Regius]], 1598–1679), Professor of Medicine at the University of Utrecht, was condemned by the Rector of the University, [[Gijsbert Voet]] (Voetius), for teaching Descartes' physics.<ref>Cottingham, John, Dugald Murdoch, and Robert Stoothof.

* 1630–1633. ''Le Monde'' (''[[The World (Descartes)|The World]]'') and ''L'Homme'' (''Man''). Descartes' first systematic presentation of his natural philosophy. ''Man'' was published posthumously in Latin translation in 1662; and ''The World'' posthumously in 1664.
* 1637. ''Discours de la méthode'' (''[[Discourse on the Method]]''). An introduction to the ''Essais'', which include the ''Dioptrique'', the ''Météores'' and the ''Géométrie''.
* 1637. ''[[La Géométrie]]'' (''Geometry''). Descartes' major work in mathematics. There is an English translation by Michael Mahoney (New York: Dover, 1979).
* 1641. ''Meditationes de prima philosophia'' (''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]''), also known as ''Metaphysical Meditations''. In Latin; a second edition, published the following year, included an additional objection and reply, and a ''Letter to Dinet''. A French translation by the Duke of Luynes, probably done without Descartes' supervision, was published in 1647. Includes six [[Meditations on First Philosophy#Objections and replies|Objections and Replies]]. 
* 1644. ''Principia philosophiae'' (''[[Principles of Philosophy]]''), a Latin textbook at first intended by Descartes to replace the Aristotelian textbooks then used in universities. A French translation, ''Principes de philosophie'' by Claude Picot, under the supervision of Descartes, appeared in 1647 with a letter-preface to Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia.
* 1647. ''Notae in programma'' (''Comments on a Certain Broadsheet''). A reply to Descartes' one-time disciple Henricus Regius.

Rediscovered in 1895 and published for the first time in 1896. An annotated bilingual edition (Latin with French translation), edited by Jean-Marie Beyssade, was published in 1981 (Paris: PUF).
* 1649. ''Les passions de l'âme'' (''[[Passions of the Soul]]''). Dedicated to Princess [[Elisabeth of the Palatinate]].
* 1657. ''Correspondance'' (three volumes: 1657, 1659, 1667). Published by Descartes' literary executor [[Claude Clerselier]]. The third edition, in 1667, was the most complete; Clerselier omitted, however, much of the material pertaining to mathematics.

In January 2010, a previously unknown letter from Descartes, dated 27 May 1641, was found by the Dutch philosopher Erik-Jan Bos when browsing through [[Google search|Google]]. Bos found the letter mentioned in a summary of autographs kept by [[Haverford College]] in [[Haverford, Pennsylvania]]. The College was unaware that the letter had never been published. This was the third letter by Descartes found in the last 25 years.<ref>{{cite web |last=Vlasblom |first=Dirk |url=http://www.nrc.nl/international/article2492445.ece/Unknown_letter_from_Descartes_found |title=Unknown letter from Descartes found |publisher=Nrc.nl |date=25 February 2010 |accessdate=30 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{nl}}[http://www.nrc.nl/wetenschap/article2491995.ece/Hoe_Descartes_in_1641_op_andere_gedachten_kwam " Hoe Descartes in 1641 op andere gedachten kwam – Onbekende brief van Franse filosoof gevonden"]</ref>
