'''Ludwig Heinrich Edler von Mises'''<ref>{{German title|Edler}}</ref> ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|iː|z|iː|z}};<ref>Also {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|iː|s|iː|z}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|iː|z|ɪ|z}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|iː|s|ɪ|z}} (see [http://www.ronpaulforums.com/showthread.php?195595-How-do-you-pronounce-Mises "View Poll Results: How do you pronounce 'Mises'?"]).</ref> {{IPA-de|ˈluːtvɪç fɔn ˈmiːzəs|lang}}; 29 September 1881 – 10 October 1973) was an Austrian-American theoretical [[Austrian School]] economist. Mises wrote and lectured extensively on behalf of [[classical liberalism]]. He is best known for his work on [[praxeology]], a study of human choice and action.

Mises emigrated from Austria to the United States in 1940. Since the mid-20th century, the [[libertarianism|libertarian]] movement in the United States has been strongly influenced by Mises's writings.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Mises's student, [[Friedrich Hayek]], viewed Mises as one of the major figures in the revival of liberalism in the post-war era. Hayek's work, "The Transmission of the Ideals of Freedom" (1951) pays high tribute to the influence of Mises in the twentieth century libertarian movement.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hayek|first1=Friedrich A.|title=The Transmission of the Ideals of Economic Freedom|journal=Econ Journal Watch|date=2012|volume=9|issue=2|pages=163–69|url=https://econjwatch.org/articles/the-transmission-of-the-ideals-of-economic-freedom?ref=articles}}</ref>

Mises's Austrian School was a leading group of economists. Many of its alumni, including Hayek and [[Oskar Morgenstern]], emigrated from Austria to the United States and Great Britain. Mises has been described as having approximately seventy close students in Austria,<ref>Beller, Steven (1989). ''Vienna and the Jews, 1867–1938: A Cultural History''. Cambridge University Press.</ref> and the Austrians as the insiders of the Chicago School of economics.<ref>Klein, Naomi (2007). ''The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism''</ref> The [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] was founded in the United States to continue his teachings.

===Early life===
[[File:Misescrest.gif|left|thumb|[[Coat of arms]] of Ludwig von Mises's great-grandfather, Mayer Rachmiel Mises, awarded upon his 1881 ennoblement by [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]]]]

Ludwig von Mises was born to [[Lviv#Jews|Jewish]] parents in the city of Lemberg, [[Austrian Galicia|Galicia]], [[Austria-Hungary]] (now [[Lviv]], [[Ukraine]]). The family of his father Arthur Edler von Mises had been elevated to the Austrian nobility in the 19th century (Edler indicates a noble landless family); they had been involved in financing and constructing railroads.  Ludwig's mother, Adele (née: Landau), was a niece of Dr. Joachim Landau, a Liberal Party deputy to the Austrian Parliament.<ref name=Knight>{{cite book |last=Hülsmann |first=Jörg Guido |title=Mises: The Last Knight of Liberalism |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-933550-18-3}}</ref>{{rp|3–9}} Arthur von Mises was stationed in Lemberg as a construction engineer with the Czernowitz railway company.

===Life in Europe===
In the years from 1904 to 1914, Mises attended lectures given by Austrian economist [[Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk]].<ref>Mises, Ludwig von, ''The Historical Setting of the Austrian School of Economics'', Arlington House, 1969, reprinted by the [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], 1984, p. 10, Rothbard, Murray, ''The Essential Ludwig von Mises'', 2nd printing, Ludwig von Mises Institute, 1983, p. 30.</ref> He graduated in February 1906 ([[Juris Doctor]]) and started a career as a civil servant in Austria's financial administration.

After a few months, he left to take a trainee position in a Vienna law firm. During that time, Mises began lecturing on economics, and in early 1909, he joined the Vienna Chamber of Commerce and Industry.  During [[World War I]], Mises served as a front officer in the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] artillery and as an economic adviser to the War Department.

Mises was chief economist for the Austrian Chamber of Commerce and was an economic adviser of [[Engelbert Dollfuss]], the [[austrofascist]] but strongly [[Anti-fascism|anti-Nazi]] [[Austrian Chancellor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/freemarket_detail.aspx?control=137 |title=The Free Market: Meaning of the Mises Papers, The |publisher=Mises.org |date= |accessdate=2009-11-26}}</ref> Later he was economic adviser to [[Otto von Habsburg]], the [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] politician and claimant to the [[Emperor of Austria|throne of Austria]] (which had been legally abolished in 1918 following the Great War).<ref name="My Years">Mises, Margit von, [https://mises.org/sites/default/files/My%20Years%20with%20Ludwig%20von%20Mises_2.pdf ''My Years with Ludwig von Mises''], [[Arlington House Publishers]], 1976; 2nd enlarged ed., Cedar Falls, IA: Center for Futures Education, 1984. {{ISBN|978-0915513000}}. {{OCLC|11668538}}</ref> In 1934, Mises left Austria for Geneva, Switzerland, where he was a professor at the [[Graduate Institute of International Studies]] until 1940.

While in Switzerland, Mises married Margit Herzfeld Serény, a former actress and widow of Ferdinand Serény. She was the mother of [[Gitta Sereny]].

===Work in the United States===
In 1940 Mises and his wife fled the German advance in Europe and emigrated to New York City in the United States.<ref name=Knight />{{rp|xi}} He had come to the United States under a grant by the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]. Like many other classical liberal scholars who fled to the US, he received support by the [[William Volker Fund]] to obtain a position in American universities.<ref name=Kitch>{{cite journal|last=Kitch|first=Edmund W.|title=The Fire of Truth: A Remembrance of Law and Economics at Chicago, 1932–1970|journal=Journal of Law and Economics|date=April 1983|volume=26|issue=1|pages=163–234|doi=10.1086/467030}}</ref> Mises became a visiting professor at [[New York University]], and held this position from 1945 until his retirement in 1969 – though he was not salaried by the university.<ref name="law"/> Businessman and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] commentator [[Lawrence Fertig]], a member of the NYU Board of Trustees, funded Mises and his work.<ref>Moss, Laurence S.

For part of this period, Mises studied [[currency]] issues for the [[International Paneuropean Union|Pan-Europa movement]], which was led by [[Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi]], a fellow NYU faculty member and Austrian exile.<ref>{{cite book |last=Coudenhove-Kalergi |first=Richard Nikolaus, Graf von |authorlink=Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi |title=An idea conquers the world |publisher=Hutchinson |location=London |year=1953 |page=247}}</ref> In 1947, Mises became one of the founding members of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]].

In 1962, Mises received the [[Austrian Decoration for Science and Art]] for political economy<ref>[http://www.kurienwissenschaftundkunst.at/archiv/archiv-mitglieder-wissenschaft/  Kurien Society of Science and Art website], Listing of recipients of the [[Austrian Decoration for Science and Art]]; [https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=de&tl=en&js=n&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&eotf=1&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kurienwissenschaftundkunst.at%2Farchiv%2Farchiv-mitglieder-wissenschaft%2F Google Translated page], ''accessed June 5, 2013.''</ref> at the [[Embassy of Austria, Washington, D.C.|Austrian Embassy in Washington, D.C.]]<ref name=Knight />{{rp|1034}}

At one time, Mises praised the work of philosopher and novelist [[Ayn Rand]] and she generally looked on his work with favor. But the two had a volatile relationship, with strong disagreements, for example over the moral basis of capitalism.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jennifer Burns|title=Goddess of the Market: Ayn Rand and the American Right|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z6e9X6JxHpMC&pg=PA106|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=106, 141|isbn=9780199740895}}</ref>

==Contributions and influence in economics==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2013}}
Mises wrote and lectured extensively on behalf of [[classical liberalism]].<ref>For example, Murray Rothbard, a leading Austrian school economist, has written that, by the 1920s, "Mises was clearly the outstanding bearer of the great Austrian tradition." ''Ludwig von Mises: Scholar, Creator, Hero'', the Ludwig von Mises Institute, 1988, p. 25.</ref> In his magnum opus ''[[Human Action]]'', Mises adopted [[praxeology]] as a general conceptual foundation of the social sciences and set forth his methodological approach to economics.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Friends and students of Mises in Europe included [[Wilhelm Röpke]] and [[Alfred Müller-Armack]] (advisors to German chancellor [[Ludwig Erhard]]), [[Jacques Rueff]] (monetary advisor to [[Charles de Gaulle]]), [[Gottfried Haberler]] (later a professor at [[Harvard University|Harvard]]), [[Lionel Robbins, Baron Robbins|Lionel, Lord Robbins]] (of the [[London School of Economics]]), Italian President [[Luigi Einaudi]], and [[Leonid Hurwicz]], recipient of the 2007 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences.<ref>Rothbard, Murray, ''Ludwig von Mises: Scholar, Creator, Hero'', the Ludwig von Mises Institute, 1988, p. 67.</ref> Economist and political theorist [[F.A. Hayek]] first came to know Mises while working as his subordinate at a government office dealing with Austria's post-World War I debt. In 1956, while toasting Mises at a party, Hayek said, "I came to know him as one of the best educated and informed men I have ever known..."<ref name="My Years" />{{rp|219–20}}

Mises' seminars in Vienna fostered lively discussion among established economists there. The meetings were also visited by other important economists who happened to be traveling through Vienna.

In New York, at his NYU seminar and at informal meetings at his apartment, Mises attracted college and high school students who had heard of his European reputation. They listened while he gave carefully prepared lectures from notes.<ref name=Vaughn>{{cite book|last=Vaughn|first=Karen I|title=Austrian Economics in America|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zQx7fHjtOIUC&pg=PA66|isbn=9780521637657}}p. 66–67.</ref><ref>Reisman, George, ''Capitalism: a Treatise on Economics'', "Introduction," Jameson Books, 1996; and Mises, Margit von, ''My Years with Ludwig von Mises'', 2nd enlarged edit., Center for Future Education, 1984, pp. 136–37.</ref> Among those who attended his informal seminar over the course of two decades in New York were [[Israel Kirzner]], [[Hans Sennholz]], [[Ralph Raico]], [[Leonard Liggio]], [[George Reisman]] and [[Murray Rothbard]].<ref>On Mises's influence, see Rothbard, Murray, ''The Essential Ludwig von Mises'', 2nd printing, the Ludwig von Mises Institute, 1983; on Eastman's conversion "from Marx to Mises," see Diggins, John P., ''Up From Communism'' Harper & Row, 1975, pp. 201–33; on Mises's students and seminar attendees, see Mises, Margit von, ''My Years with Ludwig von Mises'', Arlington House, 1976, 2nd enlarged edit., Center for Future Education, 1984.</ref> Mises' work also influenced other Americans, including [[Benjamin Anderson]], [[Leonard Read]], [[Henry Hazlitt]], [[Max Eastman]], legal scholar Sylvester J. Petro, and novelist [[Ayn Rand]].

==Criticisms==
Economic historian [[Bruce Caldwell (economic historian)|Bruce Caldwell]] writes that in the mid-20th century, with the ascendance of [[positivism]] and [[Keynesian economics|Keynesianism]], Mises came to be regarded by many as the "archetypal 'unscientific' economist."<ref name="BC1">{{Cite book |title=Hayek's Challenge|publisher=The University of Chicago Press |first=Bruce |last=Caldwell |year=2004 | pages=125–26 |isbn=978-0-226-09191-4 |ref=harv }}</ref> In a 1957 review of his book ''[[The Anti-Capitalistic Mentality]]'', ''[[The Economist]]'' said of Mises: "Professor von Mises has a splendid analytical mind and an admirable passion for liberty; but as a student of [[human nature]] he is worse than null and as a debater he is of [[Speakers' Corner|Hyde Park]] standard."<ref>[https://www.webcitation.org/5fRAcAwrL?url=http://62.190.209.167/exe/wwt.exe/htt?fn%3D%5C%5CAsteryx%5Cpublic1%5CEconomist%5Cjpg%5CReel1957%5Cecon-1957-0413-0039-0000.jpg%26zoom%3D100%26type%3Dj%26Quality%3D100 "Liberalism in Caricature"], ''[[The Economist]]''</ref>  Conservative commentator [[Whittaker Chambers]] published a similarly negative review of that book in the ''[[National Review]],'' stating that Mises's thesis that anti-capitalist sentiment was rooted in "envy" epitomized "know-nothing conservatism" at its "know-nothingest."<ref>Quoted in [[Sam Tanenhaus]], ''Whittaker Chambers: A Biography'', (Random House, New York, 1997), p. 500.  {{ISBN|978-0-375-75145-5}}.</ref>

In a 1978 interview, Friedrich Hayek said about Mises's book ''[[Socialism (book)|Socialism]]:''

{{quote|At first we all felt he was frightfully exaggerating and even offensive in tone. You see, he hurt all our deepest feelings, but gradually he won us around, although for a long time I had to – I just learned he was usually right in his conclusions, but I was not completely satisfied with his argument.<ref>[[UCLA]] Oral History [https://archive.org/details/nobelprizewinnin00haye (Interview with Friedrich Hayek)], ''[[American Libraries]]''/''[[Internet Archive]]'', 1978. Retrieved on 4 April 2009 ([http://blog.mises.org/archives/009657.asp Blog.Mises.org]), source with quotes</ref>}}

Economist [[Milton Friedman]] considered Mises inflexible in his thinking:

{{quote|The story I remember best happened at the initial Mont Pelerin meeting when he got up and said, "You're all a bunch of socialists." We were discussing the distribution of income, and whether you should have progressive income taxes. Some of the people there were expressing the view that there could be a justification for it.

Another occasion which is equally telling: Fritz Machlup was a student of Mises's, one of his most faithful disciples. At one of the Mont Pelerin meetings, Machlup gave a talk in which I think he questioned the idea of a gold standard; he came out in favor of floating exchange rates. Mises was so mad he wouldn't speak to Machlup for three years. Some people had to come around and bring them together again. It's hard to understand; you can get some understanding of it by taking into account how people like Mises were persecuted in their lives.<ref>{{cite journal | authorlink = Brian Doherty | title = Best of Both Worlds (Interview with Milton Friedman) | journal = Reason | date = June 1995 | url = http://www.reason.com/news/show/29691.html }}</ref>}}

Economist [[Murray Rothbard]], who studied under Mises, agreed he was uncompromising, but disputes reports of his abrasiveness. In his words, Mises was "unbelievably sweet, constantly finding research projects for students to do, unfailingly courteous, and never bitter" about the discrimination he received at the hands of the economic establishment of his time.<ref>Murray Rothbard, {{YouTube|KWdUIuID8ag|"The Future of Austrian Economics"}}, 1990 talk at Mises University at Stanford, at MisesMedia Youtube channel.</ref>

Mises' 1927 book ''Liberalism'' has been largely ignored, except for its comments on [[fascism]]. Marxists [[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[Perry Anderson]], as well as German writer Claus-Dieter Krohn, criticized Mises for writing approvingly of Italian fascism, especially for its suppression of leftist elements.<ref>Ralph Raico, "Mises on Fascism, Democracy, and Other Questions, ''Journal of Libertarian Studies'' (1996) 12:1 pp. 1–27</ref> In 2009 economist [[J. Bradford DeLong]] and sociologist [[Richard Seymour (writer)|Richard Seymour]], repeated the criticism.<ref>Richard Seymour, [''The Meaning of Cameron''], (Zero Books, John Hunt, London, 2010), [https://books.google.com/books?id=lCtbIPZbUTwC&pg=PA32 p. 32], {{ISBN|1846944562}}</ref> </blockquote>

Mises wrote in the 1927 book:<ref>Ludwig von Mises, [https://mises.org/liberal/ch1sec10.asp "Liberalism"], Chapter 10, The Argument of Fascism, 1927.</ref>

{{quote|It cannot be denied that Fascism and similar movements aiming at the establishment of dictatorships are full of the best intentions and that their intervention has, for the moment, saved European civilization. The merit that Fascism has thereby won for itself will live on eternally in history. But though its policy has brought salvation for the moment, it is not of the kind which could promise continued success. Fascism was an emergency makeshift. To view it as something more would be a fatal error.}}

Mises biographer [[Jörg Guido Hülsmann]] says that critics who suggest that Mises supported fascism are "absurd", as he notes that the full quote describes fascism as dangerous. He notes that Mises thought it was a "fatal error" to think that it was more than an "emergency makeshift" against the looming threat of communism and socialism, as exemplified by the [[Bolsheviks]] in Russia.<ref name=Knight />{{rp|560}}

After Mises died, his widow quoted a passage that he had written about [[Benjamin Anderson]]. She said it best described Mises's own personality:
<blockquote>His most eminent qualities were his inflexible honesty, his unhesitating sincerity. He never yielded. He always freely enunciated what he considered to be true. If he had been prepared to suppress or only to soften his criticisms of popular, but irresponsible, policies, the most influential positions and offices would have been offered him. But he never compromised.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kirzner |first=Israel M. |title=Ludwig von Mises: The Man and his Economics |year=2001 |publisher=ISI Books |location=Wilmington, DE |isbn=9781882926688 |page=31 |authorlink=Israel Kirzner |oclc=47734733}}</ref></blockquote>
