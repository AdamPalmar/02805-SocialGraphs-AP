'''Yiannis Nicholas Moschovakis''' ({{lang-el|Γιάννης Μοσχοβάκης}}; born January 18, 1938) is a [[Set theory|set theorist]], [[Descriptive set theory|descriptive set theorist]], and [[recursion theory|recursion (computability) theorist]], at [[UCLA]]. For many years he has split his time between UCLA and [[University of Athens]] <!--(he retired from the latter in July, 2005)-->.  His book ''Descriptive Set Theory'' (North-Holland) is the primary reference for the subject. He is especially associated with the development of the [[Effective descriptive set theory|effective]], or [[lightface pointclass|lightface]], version of descriptive set theory, and he is known for the [[Moschovakis coding lemma]] that is named after him.

Moschovakis earned his [[Ph.D.]] from [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in 1963 under the direction of [[Stephen Kleene]], with a dissertation entitled ''Recursive Analysis''. In 2015 he was elected as a [[fellow]] of the [[American Mathematical Society]] "for contributions to mathematical logic, especially set theory and computability theory, and for exposition".<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.ams.org/profession/ams-fellows/new-fellows|title=2016 Class of the Fellows of the AMS|publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]]|accessdate=2015-11-16}}.</ref>

Moschovakis is married to [[Joan Moschovakis]], with whom he gave the 2014 Lindström Lectures at the [[University of Gothenburg]].<ref>http://flov.gu.se/english/research/logic/lindstrom-lectures</ref>
