'''Philip Edward Bertrand Jourdain''' (16 October 1879 – 1 October 1919) was a British [[logician]] and follower of [[Bertrand Russell]].

He was born in [[Ashbourne, Derbyshire|Ashbourne]] in Derbyshire<ref>*{{MacTutor Biography|id=Jourdain}}</ref> one of a large family belonging to Emily Clay and his father  Francis Jourdain (who was the vicar at Ashbourne).<ref name=turn/> He was partly disabled by [[Friedreich's ataxia]]. He corresponded with [[Georg Cantor]] and [[Gottlob Frege]], and took a close interest in the paradoxes related to [[Russell's paradox]], formulating the [[card paradox]] version of the [[liar paradox]].<ref name=turn>[http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Jourdain.html Turnbull archive] accessed 7 December 2007</ref> He corresponded with [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], meeting with him in Cambridge to discuss Frege's book [[Grundgesetze der Arithmetik]], of parts of which Jourdain had prepared a translation. He also worked on [[algebraic logic]], and the [[history of science]] with [[Isaac Newton]] as a particular study. He was London editor for ''[[The Monist]]''. Near the end of his life he became increasingly obsessed by trying to prove the [[axiom of choice]], and published several incorrect proofs of it. {{harvtxt|Littlewood|1986|loc=p.129}} describes Jourdain on his deathbed still arguing with him about his (incorrect) proof of the axiom of choice. 

His sister [[Eleanor Jourdain]] was an English academic and author. Another sister, Margaret (1876-1951), was an authority on the history of fine English home-furnishings, and the life-long companion of the novelist Ivy Compton-Burnett.
