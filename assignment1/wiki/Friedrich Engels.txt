Engels founded [[Marxism|Marxist theory]] together with [[Karl Marx]] and in 1845 published ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844|The Condition of the Working Class in England]]'', based on personal observations and research in [[Manchester]]. In 1848, Engels co-authored ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' with Marx and also authored and co-authored (primarily with Marx) many other works. Later, Engels supported Marx financially to do research and write ''[[Das Kapital]]''. After Marx's death, Engels edited the second and third volumes. Additionally, Engels organised Marx's notes on the ''[[Theories of Surplus Value]]'', which he later published as the "fourth volume" of ''Capital''.<ref>''[[Theories of Surplus Value]]'', in ''Collected Works of Marx and Englels: Volumes 30, 31 and 32'' (International Publishers: New York, 1988).</ref>

==Biography==
===Early years===
[[File:280505 001 Engelshaus Barmen.jpg|thumb|250px|The Engels family house at [[Barmen]] (now in [[Wuppertal]]), Germany]]
Engels was born on 28 November 1820 in [[Barmen]], [[Province of Jülich-Cleves-Berg]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] (now [[Wuppertal]], Germany).<ref>A copy of Friedrich Engels's birth certificate is on page 577 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 2'' (New York: International Publishers, 1975).</ref> Barmen was an expanding industrial metropolis and he was the eldest son of a wealthy German cotton [[textile industry|textile manufacturer]] Friedrich Sr. (1796–1860) and Elisabeth "Elise" Franziska Mauritia von Haar (1797–1873). His parents were [[Pietism|Pietistic]] Protestant{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} and Engels was raised accordingly. However, as Engels grew up he developed [[Atheism|atheistic]] beliefs and his relationship with his parents became strained.<ref>{{cite web |author=Friedrich Engels |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/letters/45_03_17.htm |title=Letters of Marx and Engels, 1845 |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2010-02-13}}</ref> His mother wrote to him of her concerns.<ref name="mothersletter">Elisabeth Engels's letter contained at No. 6 of the Appendix, ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 38'' (International Publishers: New York, 1982) pp. 540–541.</ref> She said that he had "really gone too far" and "begged" him "to proceed no further".<ref name="mothersletter"/> She continued:
<blockquote>You have paid more heed to other people, to strangers, and have taken no account of your mother's pleas. God alone knows what I have felt and suffered of late. I was trembling when I picked up the newspaper and saw therein that a warrant was out for my son's arrest.<ref name="mothersletter"/></blockquote>When his mother wrote, Engels was in hiding in [[Brussels]], Belgium, soon to make his way to [[Switzerland]]. In 1849, he returned to the Kingdom of Bavaria for the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Baden and Palatinate revolutionary uprising]].

At 17, Engels had dropped out of high school due to family circumstances.{{clarify|date=August 2017}} Engels spent a year in Barmen. In 1838, his father sent the young Engels to work as a nonsalaried office clerk at a commercial house in [[Bremen]].<ref name="engels-bio">{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1895/misc/engels-bio.htm |title=Lenin: Friedrich Engels |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2010-02-13}}</ref><ref name="tucker">Tucker, Robert C. ''The Marx-Engels Reader'', p. xv</ref> His parents expected that he would follow his father into a career in business. His revolutionary activities disappointed them. It would be some years before he joined the family firm.

Whilst at Bremen, Engels began reading the philosophy of [[Hegel]], whose teachings dominated German philosophy. In September 1838, he published his first work, a poem entitled "The Bedouin", in the ''Bremisches Conversationsblatt'' No. 40. He also engaged in other literary and journalistic work.<ref>{{cite web |author=Progress Publishers |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/cw/volume02/preface.htm |title=Preface by Progress Publishers |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2010-02-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/cw/volume02/footnote.htm#188 |title=Footnotes to Volume 1 of Marx Engels Collected Works |publisher=Marxists.org |date=15 November 1941 |accessdate=2010-02-13}}</ref> Also while at Bremen, Engels began writing newspaper articles critiquing the societal ills of industrialisation. He wrote under a pseudonym, Friedrich Oswald, to avoid connecting his life in a Pietist industrialist family with his provocative writings. In 1841, Engels joined the [[Prussian Army]] as a member of the Household Artillery. He was assigned to Berlin, where he attended university lectures at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] and began to associate with groups of [[Young Hegelians]]. He anonymously published articles in the ''[[Rheinische Zeitung]],'' exposing the poor employment and living conditions endured by factory workers.<ref name="tucker" /> The editor of the ''Rheinische Zeitung'' was Karl Marx. Engels did not meet Marx until late November 1842.<ref>Heinrich Gemkow ''et al''., ''Friedrich Engels: A Biography'' (Verlag Zeit im Bild: Dresden, Germany, 1972) p. 53.</ref> Engels acknowledged the influence of German philosophy on his [[intellectual]] development throughout his life.<ref name="engels-bio" /> He also wrote, "To get the most out of life you must be active, you must live and you must have the courage to taste the thrill of being young ... " (1840).{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Manchester===
In 1842, his parents sent the 22-year-old Engels to [[Manchester]], England, a manufacturing centre. He was to work in [[Weaste]] in the offices of [[Baumwollspinnerei Ermen & Engels|Ermen and Engels]]'s Victoria Mill, which made sewing threads.<ref name="en-1893">{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/bio/engels/en-1893.htm |title=Biography on Engels |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2010-02-13}}</ref><ref name="bbc-art1">{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/work/england/manchester/article_1.shtml |title=Legacies – Work – England – Manchester – Engels in Manchester – Article Page 1 |publisher=[[BBC]] |date= |accessdate=2010-02-13}}</ref><ref>''Salford Star,'' issue 6 Winter 2007, read on http://www.salfordstar.com/article.asp?id=461</ref> Engels's father thought that working at the Manchester firm might make his son reconsider some of his liberal opinions.<ref name="engels-bio" /><ref name="bbc-art1" /> On his way to Manchester, Engels visited the office of the ''[[Rheinische Zeitung]]'' and met Karl Marx for the first time.

In Manchester, Engels met [[Mary Burns]], a fierce young working woman with radical opinions. They began a relationship that lasted 20 years until her death in 1863.<ref name="bbc-art2">{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/work/england/manchester/article_2.shtml |title=Legacies – Work – England – Manchester – Engels in Manchester – Article Page 2 |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2010-02-13}}</ref><ref>"Friedrich Engels in Manchester", Roy Whitfield, 1988</ref> The two never married, as both were against the institution of marriage.

While in Manchester between October and November 1843, Engels wrote his first economic work, entitled "Outline of a Critique of Political Economy."<ref>"Outline of a Critique of Political Economy," ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 3'' ([[International Publishers]]: New York, 1975), pp. 418–445.</ref> Engels sent the article to Paris, where Marx published it in the ''[[Deutsch–Französische Jahrbücher]]'' in 1844.<ref name="en-1893"/>

While observing the slums of Manchester in close detail, Engels took notes of its horrors, notably [[child labour]], the despoiled environment, and overworked and impoverished labourers.<ref name="NYT">[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/19/books/19garner.html?_r=2&pagewanted=all Fox Hunter, Party Animal, Leftist Warrior] by Dwight Garner, ''[[The New York Times]]'', 18 August 2009</ref> He sent a trilogy of articles to Marx. These were published in the ''Rheinische Zeitung'' and then in the ''Deutsch–Französische Jahrbücher'', chronicling the conditions among the working class in Manchester. He later collected these articles for his influential first book, ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844|The Condition of the Working Class in England]]'' (1845).<ref>''The Condition of the Working Class in England'', in the ''Collected Works of Marx and Engels: Volume 4'' (International Publishers: New York, 1975) pp. 295–596.</ref> Written between September 1844 and March 1845, the book was published in German in 1845. In the book, Engels described the "grim future of capitalism and the industrial age",<ref name="NYT" /> noting the details of the squalor in which the working people lived.<ref name="salfordstar.com">''Salford Star,'' Issue 6 Winter 2007, [http://www.salfordstar.com/article.asp?id=456 "Friedrich Engels in Salford" part 1]</ref> The book was published in English in 1887. Archival resources contemporary to Engels's stay in Manchester shed light on some of the conditions he describes, including a manuscript ([http://archives.li.man.ac.uk/ead/html/gb133mmm-p13.shtml#MMM-10-1 MMM/10/1]) held by special collections at the University of Manchester which recounts cases seen in the Manchester Royal Infirmary, where industrial accidents dominate and which resonates with his comments on the deformed persons seen walking round Manchester as a result of such accidents.

Engels continued his involvement with radical journalism and politics. He frequented areas popular among members of the English [[Labour movement|labour]] and [[Chartism|Chartist]] movements, whom he met. He also wrote for several journals, including ''[[Northern Star (chartist newspaper)|The Northern Star]]'', [[Robert Owen]]'s ''[[New Moral World]],'' and the ''[[Democratic Review]]'' newspaper.<ref name="bbc-art2" /><ref>{{cite web |author=Karl Marx |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/05/04.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040314204539/http://www.marxists.org:80/archive/marx/works/1880/05/04.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2004-03-14 |title=Introduction to the French Edition of Engels |date=1880 |publisher=Marxists.org |accessdate=2010-02-13}}</ref><ref>Whitfield, Roy (1988) "The Double Life of Friedrich Engels."

Engels decided to return to Germany in 1844. On the way, he stopped in Paris to meet [[Karl Marx]], with whom he had an earlier correspondence. Marx had been living in Paris since late October 1843, after the ''Rheinische Zeitung'' was banned in March 1843 by Prussian governmental authorities.<ref>P. N. Fedoseyev, ''Karl Marx: A Biography'' (Progress Publishers: Moscow, 1973) pp. 41–42 & 49.</ref> Prior to meeting Marx, Engels had become established as a fully developed [[Dialectical materialism|materialist]] and [[Scientific socialism|scientific socialist]], independent of Marx's philosophical development.<ref>P. N. Fedoseyev, ''et al.'', ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', p. 71.</ref>

In Paris, Marx was publishing the ''[[Deutsch–Französische Jahrbücher]].'' Engels first met Marx at the [[Café de la Régence]] on the Place du Palais, 28 August 1844. The two quickly became close friends and remained so their entire lives. Marx had read and was impressed by Engels's articles on ''The Condition of the Working Class in England.''<ref>Friedrich Engels, "The Condition of the Working Class of England," ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 4'' (International Publishers: New York, 1975) pp. 295 through 596.</ref> Marx adopted Engels's idea that the working class would lead the revolution against the bourgeoisie as society advanced toward socialism, and incorporated this as part of his own philosophy.<ref>P. N. Fedoseyev, ''et al.'', ''Karl Marx: A Biography'' (Progress Publishers: Moscow, 1973) pp. 82–83.</ref> In late May 1845 Engels published the English version of his new book. He wrote, "A class which bears all the disadvantages of the social order without enjoying its advantages … Who can demand that such a class respect this social order?"<ref>Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, ''Collected Works: Volume 4,'' p. 424.</ref>

Engels stayed in Paris to help Marx write ''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]''.<ref>''The Holy Family,'' ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 4'', pp. 3 through 211.</ref> It was an attack on the [[Young Hegelians]] and the [[Bruno Bauer|Bauer]] brothers, and was published in late February 1845. Engels's earliest contribution to Marx's work was writing for the ''Deutsch–Französische Jahrbücher'', edited by both Marx and [[Arnold Ruge]], in Paris in 1844.

During this time in Paris, both Marx and Engels began their association with and then joined the secret revolutionary society called the [[League of the Just]].<ref>P. N. Fedoseyev, ''et al.'', ''Karl Marx: A Biography'' (Progress Publishers: Moscow, 1973) p. 60.</ref> The League of the Just had been formed in 1837 in France to promote an egalitarian society through the overthrow of the existing governments. In 1839, the League of the Just participated in the 1839 rebellion fomented by the French utopian revolutionary socialist, [[Louis Auguste Blanqui]].

However, as Ruge remained a Young Hegelian in his belief, Marx and Ruge soon split and Ruge left the ''Deutsch–Französische Jahrbücher''<ref>P. N. Fedoseyev ''et al''., ''Karl Marx: A Biography'' pp. 57–58.</ref> Nonetheless, following the split, Marx remained friendly enough with Ruge that he sent Ruge a warning on 15 January 1845 that the Paris police were going to execute orders against him, Marx and others at the ''Deutsch–Französische Jahrbücher'' requiring all to leave Paris within 24 hours.<ref>Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, "Letter from Marx to Ruge" (15 January 1845) contained in ''Collected Works: Volume 38'', p. 15.</ref> Marx himself was expelled from Paris by French authorities on 3 February 1845 and settled in Brussels with his wife and one daughter.<ref>Heinrich Gemkow ''et al''., ''Friedrich Engels: A Biography'' p. 625.</ref> Having left Paris on 6 September 1844, Engels returned to his home in Barmen, Germany, to work on his ''The Condition of the Working Class in England'', which was published in late May 1845.<ref>Heinrich Gemkow ''et al''. ''Friedrich Engels: A Biography'' p. 625.</ref> Even before the publication of his book, Engels moved to Brussels in late April 1845, to collaborate with Marx on another book, ''[[German Ideology]]''.<ref>''German Ideology'' is located in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels'' pp. 19 through 539.</ref> While living in Barmen, Engels began making contact with Socialists in the Rhineland to raise money for Marx's publication efforts in Brussels.<ref>Heinrich Gemkow ''et al''., ''Friedrich Engels: A Biography'' p. 101.</ref> However, these contacts became more important as both Marx and Engels began political organising for the German Workers Party.

===Brussels===
From 1845 to 1848, Engels and Marx lived in [[Brussels]], spending much of their time organising the city's German workers. Shortly after their arrival, they contacted and joined the underground [[Communist League|German Communist League]]. The Communist League was the successor organisation to the old League of the Just which had been founded in 1837, but had recently disbanded.<ref>Isaiah Berlin, ''Karl Marx: His Life and Environment'' ([[Oxford University Press]]: Oxford, England, 1963) pp. 159–160.</ref> Influenced by [[Wilhelm Weitling]], the Communist League was an international society of proletarian revolutionaries with branches in various European cities.<ref>Isaiah Berlin, ''Karl Marx: His Life and Environment'' p. 160.</ref> The Communist League also had contacts with the underground conspiratorial organisation of [[Louis Auguste Blanqui]]. Many of Marx's and Engels's current friends became members of the Communist League. Old friends like [[Georg Herwegh|Georg Friedrich Herwegh]], who had worked with Marx on the ''Rheinsche Zeitung'', [[Heinrich Heine]], the famous poet, a young doctor by the name of Roland Daniels, [[Heinrich Burgers|Heinrich Bürgers]] and [[August Herman Ewerbeck]] all maintained their contacts with Marx and Engels in Brussels. [[Georg Weerth]], who had become a friend of Engels in England in 1843, now settled in Brussels. [[Karl Wallau]] and [[Stephen Born]] (real name [[Simon Buttermilch]]) were both German immigrant typesetters who settled in Brussels to help Marx and Engels with their Communist League work. Marx and Engels made many new important contacts through the Communist League. One of the first was [[Wilhelm Wolff]], who was soon to become one of Marx's and Engels's closest collaborators. Others were [[Joseph Weydemeyer]] and [[Ferdinand Freiligrath]], a famous revolutionary poet. While most of the associates of Marx and Engels were German immigrants living in Brussels, some of their new associates were Belgians. [[Phillipe Gigot]], a Belgian philosopher and [[Victor Tedesco]], a lawyer from Liège, both joined the Communist League. [[Joachim Lelewel]] a prominent Polish historian and participant in the Polish uprising of 1830–1831 was also a frequent associate.<ref>P. N.Fedoseyev ''et al''., ''Karl Marx: A Biography'' (Progress Publishers: Moscow, 1973) pp. 86–88.)</ref> The Communist League commissioned Marx and Engels to write a pamphlet explaining the principles of communism. This became ''[[Communist Manifesto|The Manifesto of the Communist Party]]'', better known as the ''Communist Manifesto''.<ref>Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, ''Manifesto of the Communist Party'' contained in the ''Collected Works Volume 6'' pp. 477–517.</ref> It was first published on 21 February 1848 and ends with the world-famous phrase: "Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communistic revolution. The proletariat have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win ... Working Men of All Countries, Unite!"<ref name="engels-bio" />

===Return to Prussia===
There was a [[Revolutions of 1848 in France|revolution in France in 1848]] that [[Revolutions of 1848|soon spread to other Western European countries]]. This event caused Engels and Marx to go back to their homeland of the [[Prussia]], specifically the city of [[Cologne]]. While living in Cologne, they created and served as editors for a new daily newspaper called the ''[[Neue Rheinische Zeitung]]''.<ref name="en-1893" /> Besides Marx and Engels, other frequent contributors to the ''Neue Rheinische Zeitung'' included [[Karl Schapper]], [[Wilhelm Wolff]], [[Ernst Dronke]], [[Peter Nothjung]], [[Heinrich Burgers|Heinrich Bürgers]], [[Ferdinand Wolf]] and Carl Cramer.<ref>Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, "Banquet in Gűrzenich" contained in the ''Collected Works: Volume 9'' (International Publishers: New York, 1977) p. 490.</ref> Friedrich Engels's mother, herself, gives unwitting witness to the effect of the ''Neue Rheinische Zeitung'' on the revolutionary uprising in Cologne in 1848. Criticising his involvement in the uprising she states in a 5 December 1848 letter to Friedrich that "nobody, ourselves included, doubted that the meetings at which you and your friends spoke, and also the language of ''(Neue) Rh.Z.'' were largely the cause of these disturbances."<ref name=p543>Elisabeth Engels's letter to Friedrich Engels contained at No. 8 of the Appendix in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 38'', p. 543.</ref>

At the time of this letter, Engels's even more dangerous involvement in the revolutionary uprisings in Baden and the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]] in 1849, still lay ahead of him. Engels's parents hoped that young Friedrich would "decide to turn to activities other than those which you have been {{sic|?|pursing|expected=pursuing}} in recent years and which have caused so much distress."<ref name=p543/> At this point Friedrich's parents felt the only hope for their son was to emigrate to America and start his life over. They told him that he should do this or he would "cease to receive money from us."<ref name=p543/> However, the problem in the relationship between Friedrich and his parents was worked out without Engels having to leave England or being cut off from financial assistance from his parents. In July 1851, Friedrich Engels's father arrived to visit him in Manchester, England. During the visit his father arranged for Friedrich to meet Peter Ermen of the office of ''Ermond & Engels'', to move to Liverpool, and to take over sole management of the office in Manchester.<ref>Friedrich Engels letter to Karl Marx dated 6 July 1851 and contained at No. 186 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 38'', p. 378.</ref>

Starting with an article called "The Magyar Struggle", written on 8 January 1849, Engels, himself, began a series of reports on the Revolution and War for Independence of the newly founded Hungarian Republic.<ref>Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, "The Magyar Struggle" contained in ''Collected Works: Volume 8'', pp. 227–238.</ref> Engels's articles on the Hungarian Republic became a regular feature in the ''Neue Rheinische Zeitung'' under the heading: "From the Theater of War."<ref>See Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, ''Collected Works: Volume 8'', pp. 451–480 and ''Volume 9, pp. 9–463.</ref>

However, during the June 1849 Prussian [[coup d'état]] the newspaper was suppressed. After the coup, Marx lost his Prussian [[citizenship]], was deported, and fled to Paris and then London. Engels stayed in Prussia and took part in an armed uprising in South Germany as an [[aide-de-camp]] in the volunteer corps of [[August Willich]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/bio/engels/en-1892.htm |title=Engels, Friedrich (encyclopedia) |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2010-02-13}}</ref><ref>Isaiah Berlin, ''Karl Marx: His Life and Environment'', 4th ed. 1978, New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996, p. 130, {{ISBN|978-0-19-510326-7}}.</ref><ref>Mike Rapport, ''1848 Year of Revolution'', London: Little Brown, 2008, p. 342, {{ISBN|978-0-316-72965-9}}.</ref> Engels also brought two cases of rifle cartridges with him when he went to join the uprising in [[Elberfeld]] on 10 May. 1849.<ref>Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, "Elberfeld" contained in the ''Collected Works: Volume 9'' (International Publishers: New York, 1977) p. 447.</ref> Later when Prussian troops came to Kaiserslautern to suppress an uprising there, Engels joined a group of volunteers under the command of August Willich, who were going to fight the Prussian troops.<ref>Heinrich Gemkow, ''et al''., ''Friedrich Engels: A Biography'' (Verlag Zeit im Bild: Dresden, 1972) p.205.</ref> When the uprising was crushed, Engels was one of the last members of Willich's volunteers to escape by crossing the Swiss border. Marx and others became concerned for Engels's life until they finally heard from him.<ref>"Letter from Engels to Jenny Marx" (25 July 1849) contained in the ''Collected Works: Volume 38'' pp. 202–204.</ref>

Engels traveled through [[Switzerland]] as a [[refugee]] and eventually made it to safety in England.<ref name="engels-bio" /> On 6 June 1849 Prussian authorities issued an arrest warrant for Engels which contained a physical description as "height: 5 feet 6 inches; hair: blond; forehead: smooth; eyebrows: blond; eyes: blue; nose and mouth: well proportioned; beard: reddish; chin: oval; face: oval; complexion: healthy; figure: slender. Special characteristics: speaks very rapidly and is short-sighted."<ref>Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, ''Collected Works: Volume 9'', p. 524,</ref> As to his "short-sightedness", Engels admitted as much in a letter written to Joseph Weydemeyer on 19 June 1851 in which he says he was not worried about being selected for the Prussian military because of "my eye trouble, as I have now found out once and for all which renders me completely unfit for active service of any sort."<ref>Friedrich Engels letter contained at No. 183 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 38'', p. 370.</ref> Once he was safe in Switzerland, Engels began to write down all his memories of the recent military campaign against the Prussians. This writing eventually became the article published under the name "The Campaign for the German Imperial Constitution."<ref>Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, ''Collected Works: Volume 10'', p. 147.</ref>

===Back in Britain===
[[File:Engel House in Primrose.jpg|thumb|Engels's house in [[Primrose Hill]], London]]
In order to help Marx with the new publishing effort in London, ''[[Neue Rheinische Zeitung Politische-okonomische Revue|Neue Rheinische Zeitung Politisch-ökonomische Revue]]'', Engels sought ways to escape the continent and travel to London. On 5 October 1849, Engels arrived in the Italian port city of Genoa.<ref>See the "Letter to from Engels to George Julian Harney" dated 5 October 1849 in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 38'' p. 217.</ref> There, Engels booked passage on the English schooner, ''Cornish Diamond'' under the command of a Captain Stevens.<ref>Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, "Letter from Engels to George Julian Harney (5 October 1849) ''Collected Works: Volume 38'' p. 217.</ref> The voyage across the western Mediterranean, around the Iberian Peninsula by sailing schooner took about five weeks. Finally, on 10 November 1849 the ''Cornish Diamond'' sailed up the River Thames to London with Engels on board.<ref>Heinrich Gemkow ''et al''., ''Friedrich Engels: A Biography'' p. 213.</ref>

Once Engels made it to Britain, he decided to re-enter the Manchester company in which his father held shares, in order to be able to support Marx financially, so that Marx could work on his masterpiece ''[[Das Kapital]]''. Engels didn't like the work but did it for the good of the cause.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/work/england/manchester/article_4.shtml |title=Legacies – Work – England – Manchester – Engels in Manchester – Article Page 4 |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2010-02-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/work/england/manchester/article_5.shtml |title=Legacies – Work – England – Manchester – Engels in Manchester – Article Page 5 |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2010-02-13}}</ref>

Unlike his first period in England (1843), Engels was now under police surveillance. He had "official" homes and "unofficial homes" all over Salford, Weaste and other inner-city Manchester districts where he lived with Mary Burns under false names to confuse the police.<ref name="salfordstar.com"/> Little more is known, as Engels destroyed over 1,500 letters between himself and Marx after the latter's death so as to conceal the details of their secretive lifestyle.<ref name="salfordstar.com"/>

Despite his work at the mill, Engels found time to write his monumental work on [[Martin Luther]], the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the [[German Peasants' War|1525 revolutionary war of the peasants]]. This work was entitled ''[[The Peasant War in Germany]]''.<ref>"The Peasant War in Germany" and s contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 10'' pp. 397 through 482.</ref> Engels also wrote some important newspaper articles such as "The Campaign for the German Imperial Constitution" which he finished in February 1850,<ref>The article called "The Campaign for the German Imperial Constitution" is contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 10'' p. 147</ref> and "On the Slogan of the Abolition of the State and the German 'Friends of Anarchy'" written in October 1850.<ref>The article "On the Slogan of the Abolition of the State and the German 'Friends of Anarchy'" is contained in the ''Collected Works of Marx and Engels: Volume 10'' p. 486.</ref> In April 1851, Engels wrote the pamphlet "Conditions and Prospects of a War of the Holy Alliance against France".<ref>The pamphlet "Conditions and Prospects of a War of the Holy Alliance against France" is contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 10'' p. 542.</ref>

When [[Napoleon III|Louis Bonaparte]] carried out a coup against the French government and made himself president for life on 2 December 1851, Marx and Engels, like many people, were shocked. In condemning this action, Engels wrote to Marx about the coup on 3 December 1851.<ref name=letter1851>Friedrich Engels's letter to Karl Marx dated 3 December 1851 contained in the "Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 38", p. 503.</ref> Engels characterised the coup as "comical"<ref name=letter1851/> and referred to it as occurring on "the 18th Brumaire"—the date of the coup according to the [[French Republican Calendar|1799 republican calendar of France]] under Napoleon I.<ref>See note 517 located at page 635 in the "Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 38.</ref> Marx was later to incorporate this comically ironic characterisation of Louis Bonaparte's coup into his essay about the coup. Indeed, Marx even called the essay ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte]]'' again using Engels's suggested characterisation.<ref>Karl Marx, "The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 11'', p. 98.</ref> Marx also borrowed Engels characterisation of Hegel's notion of the [[Geist#Hegel|World Spirit]] that history occurred twice, "once as a tragedy and secondly as a farce" in the first paragraph of his new essay.<ref>Karl Marx, "The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 11'', p. 103.</ref>

Meanwhile, at the mill owned by his father in Manchester, Engels started working as an office clerk, the same position he held in his teens while in Germany where his father's company was based. However, Friedrich worked his way up to become a partner of the firm in 1864.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Five years later, Engels retired from the business and could focus more on his studies.<ref name="en-1893" /> At this time, Marx was living in London but they were able to exchange ideas through daily correspondence. One of the ideas that Engels and Marx contemplated was the possibility and character of a potential revolution in the Russias. As early as April 1853, Engels and Marx anticipated an "aristocratic-bourgeois revolution in Russia<ref>See the letter from Friedrich Engels to Joseph Weydemeyer dated April 12, 1853 contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 39'' (New York: International Publishers, 1983) pp. 305–306.</ref> which would begin in "St. Petersburg with a resulting civil war in the interior."<ref>Letter from Fredereick Engels to Joseph Weydemeyer dated 12 April 1853 contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 39'', p. 306.</ref> The model for this type of aristocratic-bourgeois revolution in Russia against the autocratic czarist government in favour of a constitutional government had been provided by the [[Decembrist Revolt]] of 1825.<ref>W. Bruce Lincoln, ''The Romanovs: Autocrats of All the Russias'' (New York: Dial Press, 1981) pp. 408–413.</ref> Although an unsuccessful revolt against the czarist government in favour of a constitutional government, both Engels and Marx anticipated a bourgeois revolution in Russia would occur which would bring about a bourgeois stage in Russian development to precede a communist stage. By 1881, both Marx and Engels began to contemplate a course of development in Russia that would lead directly to the communist stage without the intervening bourgeois stage. This analysis was based on what Marx and Engels saw as the exceptional characteristics of the Russian village commune or [[obshchina]].<ref>See the letter from Karl Marx to Vera Zasulich contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: Volume 46'', (New York: International Press, 1992), pp. 71–72, and Engels's "Preface to the Russian Edition of 1882" in ''The Communist Manifesto''.</ref> Although doubt was cast on this theory by [[Georgi Plekhanov]], Plekhanov's reasoning was based on the first edition of ''[[Das Kapital]]'' (1867), which predated Marx's interest in Russian peasant communes by two years. Later editions of the text demonstrate Marx's sympathy for the argument of [[Nikolay Chernyshevsky]], that it should be possible to establish socialism in Russia without an intermediary bourgeois stage provided that the peasant commune were used as the basis for the transition.<ref>Gareth Stedman Jones, note on Engels's "Preface to the Russian Edition of 1882" in ''The Communist Manifesto'' (London: Penguin Books, 2002).</ref>

In 1870, Engels moved to London where he and Marx lived until Marx's death in 1883.<ref name="engels-bio" /> His London home during this period and until his death was 122 Regent's Park Road, [[Primrose Hill]], NW1.<ref>{{openplaque|213}} – Accessed July 2010</ref> Marx's first London residence was a cramped apartment at 28 [[Dean Street]], [[Soho]]. From 1856, he lived at 9 Grafton Terrace, [[Kentish Town]], and then in a tenement at 41 Maitland Park Road from 1875 until his death.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/photo/places/index.htm |title=Photos of Marx's Residence(s) |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2010-02-13}}</ref>

Mary Burns suddenly died of a heart disease in 1863, after which Engels became close with her younger sister Lydia ("[[Lizzie Burns|Lizzie]]"). They lived openly as a couple in London and married on 11 September 1878, hours before Lizzie's death.<ref name=b1>{{cite book|author=Henderson, William Otto |title=The Life of Friedrich Engels|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=teYf8gwzoB4C&pg=PA567|year=1976|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-7146-3040-3|page=567}}</ref><ref name=b2>{{cite book|author=Samuel Hollander|title=Friedrich Engels and Marxian Political Economy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qIn_Sa2wdx0C&pg=PA358|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49844-9|page=358}}</ref>

===Later years===
After Marx's death, Engels devoted much of his remaining years to editing Marx's unfinished volumes of ''Capital''. However, he also contributed significantly in other areas. Engels made an argument using [[anthropology|anthropological evidence]] of the time to show that family structures changed over history, and that the concept of [[monogamous]] marriage came from the necessity within class society for men to control women to ensure their own children would inherit their property. He argued a future communist society would allow people to make decisions about their relationships free of economic constraints. One of the best examples of Engels's thoughts on these issues are in his work ''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State]]''.

Engels died of [[Esophageal cancer|throat cancer]] in London, 1895.<ref name="Marx-Engels_Correspondence_1895">{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1895/letters/95_05_21.htm |title=Letters: Marx-Engels Correspondence 1895 |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2010-02-13}}</ref> Following cremation at [[Woking Crematorium]], his ashes were scattered off [[Beachy Head]], near [[Eastbourne]] as he had requested.<ref name="Marx-Engels_Correspondence_1895" /><ref>{{cite book |last=Kerrigan |first=Michael |title=Who Lies Where – A guide to famous graves |year=1998 |publisher=Fourth Estate Limited |location=London |isbn=1-85702-258-0 |page=156}}</ref>

==Personality==

Engels's interests included poetry, [[fox hunting]], and hosting regular Sunday parties for London's left-wing [[intelligentsia]] where, as one regular put it, "no one left before two or three in the morning." His stated personal motto was "take it easy", while "jollity" was listed as his favourite virtue.<ref>{{cite web|author=Engels |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1868/04/01.htm |title=Friedrich Engels's "Confession" |publisher=Marxists Internet Archive |date= |accessdate=2014-10-25 |first=Friedrich |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427034624/http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1868/04/01.htm |archivedate=27 April 2014 }}</ref>

[[Tristram Hunt]], author of ''Marx's General: The Revolutionary Life of Friedrich Engels'',<ref name="Hunt_2009"/> sums up the disconnect between Engels's personality, and those Soviets who later utilised his works, stating:
{{quote|This great lover of the good life, passionate advocate of individuality, and enthusiastic believer in literature, culture, art and music as an open forum could never have acceded to the Soviet Communism of the 20th century, all the Stalinist claims of his paternity notwithstanding.<ref name="Hunt_2009"/><ref name="NYT" />}}

As to the religious persuasion attributable to Engels, Hunt writes:
{{quote|In that sense the latent rationality of Christianity comes to permeate the everyday experience of the modern world—its values are now variously incarnated in the family, civil society, and the state. What Engels particularly embraced in all of this was an idea of modern [[pantheism]] (or, rather, [[pandeism]], a merging of divinity with progressing humanity, a happy dialectical synthesis that freed him from the fixed oppositions of the pietist ethos of devout longing and estrangement. "Through [[David Strauss|Strauss]] I have now entered on the straight road to Hegelianism... The Hegelian idea of God has already become mine, and thus I am joining the ranks of the 'modern pantheists,{{'"}} Engels wrote in one of his final letters to the soon-to-be-discarded Graebers [Wilhelm and Friedrich, priest trainees and former classmates of Engels].<ref>''Marx's General: The Revolutionary Life of Friedrich Engels'' By Tristram Hunt. 2010. p. 43.</ref>}}

Engels was a [[polyglot]] and was able to write and speak in languages including Russian, Italian, Portuguese, Irish Gaelic, Spanish, Polish, French, English and [[Milanese dialect]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Friedrich Engels|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lafargue/1905/08/engels.htm|work=Marxists Internet Archive (from The Social Democrat journal)|publisher=Marxists Internet Archive|accessdate=15 April 2013|author=Paul Lafargue|author2=Jacques Bonhomme |date=15 August 1905}}</ref>

==Legacy==
[[Vladimir Lenin]] wrote: "After his friend Karl Marx (who died in 1883), Engels was the finest scholar and teacher of the modern proletariat in the whole civilised world.... In their scientific works, Marx and Engels were the first to explain that socialism is not the invention of dreamers, but the final aim and necessary result of the development of the productive forces in modern society. All recorded history hitherto has been a history of class struggle, of the succession of the rule and victory of certain social classes over others."<ref>{{cite web |author= Vladimir Ilyich Lenin |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1895/misc/engels-bio.htm|title=Friedrich Engels |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-25}}</ref>

However, Labour Party politician [[Tristram Hunt]] argues that Engels has become a convenient [[scapegoat]], too easily blamed for the state crimes of the [[Soviet Union]], Communist Southeast Asia and [[People's Republic of China|China]]. "Engels is left holding the bag of 20th century ideological extremism," Hunt writes, "while Marx is rebranded as the acceptable, postpolitical seer of [[global capitalism]]."<ref name="NYT" /> Hunt largely exonerates Engels stating that "in no intelligible sense can Engels or Marx bear culpability for the crimes of historical actors carried out generations later, even if the policies were offered up in their honor."<ref name="NYT"/>

Other writers, while admitting the distance between Marx and Engels and Stalin, are less charitable, noting for example that the anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]] predicted the oppressive potential of their ideas. "It is a fallacy that Marxism's flaws were exposed only after it was tried out in power.... [Marx and Engels] were centralisers. While talking about 'free associations of producers', they advocated discipline and hierarchy."<ref>Robert Service, ''Comrades: A World History of Communism'' (London: Macmillan, 2007) p. 37</ref>

Paul Thomas, of the [[University of California, Berkeley]], claims that while Engels had been the most important and dedicated facilitator and diffuser of Marx's writings, he significantly altered Marx's intents as he held, edited and released them in a finished form, and commentated on them. Engels attempted to fill gaps in Marx's system and extend it to other fields. He stressed [[historical materialism]] in particular, assigning it a character of scientific discovery and a doctrine, indeed forming [[Marxism]] as such. A case in point is ''[[Anti-Dühring]]'', which supporters of socialism, like its detractors, treated as an encompassing presentation of Marx's thought. And while in his extensive correspondence with German socialists Engels modestly presented his own secondary place in the couple's intellectual relationship and always emphasised Marx's outstanding role, Russian communists like Lenin raised Engels up with Marx and conflated their thoughts as if they were necessarily congruous. Soviet Marxists then developed this tendency to the state doctrine of [[Dialectical Materialism]].<ref>{{citation | last = Thomas | first = Paul | contribution = Critical Reception: Marx then and now | pages = 36–42 | title = The Cambridge Companion to Marx | editor-last = Carver | editor-first = Terrell | year = 1991 | publisher = Cambridge University Press}}<!--He cites Carver 1981 a lot, and Hobsbawm (ed) 1982 "History of Marxism", more on contextual points.--></ref>

In 2014, Engels's "magnificent beard" inspired a [[climbing wall]] sculpture in [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]]. The {{convert|16|ft|m}} high beard statue — a "symbol of wisdom and learning" — was planned to stand on the campus of the [[University of Salford]]. The arts company behind the piece, Engine, said that "the idea came from a 1980s plan to relocate an Eastern Bloc statue of the thinker to Manchester."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-30375063 |title=Friedrich Engels' beard inspires climbing sculpture in Salford |date=2014-12-09 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2017-01-31}}</ref>

Since 1931 Friedlich Engels has also an entire [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] town named after him called [[Engels, Saratov Oblast|Engels]] in [[Saratov Oblast]], [[Russia]].

==Major works==
[[File:OriginOfFamily-1884.jpg|thumb|200px|Cover of the first edition of Engels's ''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State]]'', first published in 1884]]

===''The Holy Family'' (1844)===
''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]'' was a book written by [[Marx]] and Engels in November 1844. The book is a critique on the [[Young Hegelians]] and their trend of thought which was very popular in academic circles at the time. The title was a suggestion by the publisher and is meant as a sarcastic reference to the [[Bruno Bauer|Bauer]] Brothers and their supporters.<ref name="holy-family">{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/holy-family/index.htm |title=The Holy Family by Marx and Engels |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2010-02-13}}</ref>

The book created a controversy with much of the [[Print media|press]] and caused [[Bruno Bauer]] to attempt refuting the book in an article published in Wigand's ''Vierteljahrsschrift'' in 1845. Bauer claimed that Marx and Engels misunderstood what he was trying to say. Marx later replied to his response with his own article published in the journal Gesellschaftsspiegel in January 1846. Marx also discussed the argument in chapter 2 of ''[[The German Ideology]]''.<ref name="holy-family" />

===''The Condition of the Working Class in England'' (1844)===
{{Main article|The Condition of the Working Class in England}}
''The Condition of the Working Class in England'' is a detailed description and analysis of the appalling conditions of the working class in Britain during Engels's stay in Manchester and Salford. The work also contains seminal thoughts on the state of socialism and its development. It was considered a classic in its time and must have been an eye-opener for most Germans. The work initially made rather little impact in England as it was not translated until the end of the nineteenth century. It was however very influential with historians of British industrialisation throughout the twentieth century.<ref>{{cite web|last=Griffin|first=Emma|title=The 'industrial revolution': interpretations from 1830 to the present|url=http://www.academia.edu/1843995/The_industrial_revolution_interpretations_from_1830_to_the_present|accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref>

===''Herr Eugen Dühring's Revolution in Science'' (1878)===
{{Main article|Anti-Dühring}}
Popularly known as ''Anti-Dühring'', ''Herr Eugen Dühring's Revolution in Science'' is a detailed critique of the philosophical positions of [[Eugen Dühring]], a German philosopher and critic of Marxism. In the course of replying to Dühring, Engels reviews recent advances in science and mathematics seeking to demonstrate the way in which the concepts of dialectics apply to natural phenomena. Many of these ideas were later developed in the unfinished work, ''[[Dialectics of Nature]]''. Three chapters of ''Anti-Dühring'' were later edited and published under the separate title, ''Socialism: Utopian and Scientific''.

===''Socialism: Utopian and Scientific'' (1880)===
{{Main article|Socialism: Utopian and Scientific}}
In what he presented as an extraordinarily popular piece,<ref>{{cite book | quote = From this French text, a Polish and a Spanish edition were prepared. In 1883, our German friends brought out the pamphlet in the original language. Italian, Russian, Danish, Dutch, and Roumanian translations, based upon the German text, have since been published. Thus, the present English edition, this little book circulates in 10 languages. I am not aware that any other Socialist work, not even our Communist Manifesto of 1848, or Marx's Capital, has been so often translated. In Germany, it has had four editions of about 20,000 copies in all. | last = Engels | first = Friedrich | origyear = 1892 | chapter = Introduction | title = Socialism: Utopian and Scientific | chapter-url = http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/index.htm | publisher = Progress Publishers | year = 1970 | series = Marx/Engels Selected Works | volume = 3}}<!--alternate editions at https://archive.org/search.php?query=title%3A%28Socialism%20Utopian%20and%20Scientific%29--> Cited in {{cite book | last= Carver | first = Terrell | year = 2003 | publisher = Oxford University Press | title = Engels: A Very Short Introduction | page = 56}} and {{citation | last = Thomas | first = Paul | contribution = Critical Reception: Marx then and now | title = The Cambridge Companion to Marx | editor-last = Carver | editor-first = Terrell | year = 1991 | publisher = Cambridge University Press}}</ref> Engels critiques the utopian socialists, such as [[Charles Fourier|Fourier]] and [[Robert Owen|Owen]], and provides an explanation of the socialist framework for understanding capitalism, and an outline of the progression of social and economic development from the perspective of [[historical materialism]].

===''Dialectics of Nature'' (1883)===
''[[Dialectics of Nature]]'' (German: "Dialektik der Natur") is an unfinished 1883 work by Engels that applies Marxist ideas – particularly those of dialectical materialism – to science. It was first published in the USSR in 1925.<ref>marxists.anu.edu.au/archive/marx/works/1883/don/</ref>

===''The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State'' (1884)===
{{Main article|The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State}}
''The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State'' is a work connecting capitalism with what Engels argues is an ever-changing institution – the family. It was written when Engels was 64 years of age and at the height of his [[intellectual]] power. It contains an historical view of the family in relation to issues of class, female subjugation and [[private property]].
