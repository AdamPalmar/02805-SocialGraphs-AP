He married Louise Hafliger on 3 September 1927 and they had one son, David Virgil Aldrich.

==Academic career==
Aldrich's first academic appointment was his appointment as an [[professor|instructor]] in [[philosophy]] at [[Rice University]] in 1931 and Sterling Fellow at [[Yale University]] in 1931-32. Promoted to [[assistant professor]], he remained at Rice until 1942, when he was appointed visiting professor at [[Columbia University]] from 1942 to 1946. Appointed [[professor]] of philosophy at [[Kenyon College]] in 1946, he remained there until 1965, serving as visiting professor at [[Brown University]] in 1962-63.

=="Some Meanings of Vague" (1937)==

In his article "Some Meanings of Vague",<ref>''Analysis'', Vol. 4, No. 6 (Aug. 1937), pp. 89–95, Published by: Blackwell Publishing on behalf of The Analysis Committee.</ref> Aldrich puts forth a series of definitions of [[vagueness|vague]] objects and [[sensum]], and then argues that any empiricist must account for vague sensum every bit as much as clear sensum, without skirting the issue.  He takes there to be many kinds of vagueness—importantly, there is vagueness of symbols and vagueness of senses.  Here symbols are anything which is used to refer, including verbal words, signs, pictures, and more.  Vagueness regarding symbols can be the same as the vagueness which regards the senses.  There can, additionally, be vagueness of the practices surrounding the use of the symbol to refer.  These, he suggests, should be avoided.
