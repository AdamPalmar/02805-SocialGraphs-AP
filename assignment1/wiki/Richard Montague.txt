'''Richard Merritt Montague''' (September 20, 1930 – March 7, 1971) was an [[United States|American]] [[mathematician]] and [[philosopher]].

==Career==
At the [[University of California, Berkeley]], Montague earned a B.A. in Philosophy in 1950, an M.A. in Mathematics in 1953, and a [[Ph.D.]] in Philosophy 1957, the latter under the direction of the mathematician and logician [[Alfred Tarski]]. Montague, one of Tarski's most accomplished American students, spent his entire career teaching in the [[UCLA Department of Philosophy]], where he supervised the dissertations of [[Nino Cocchiarella]] and [[Hans Kamp]].

Montague wrote on the foundations of [[logic]] and [[set theory]], as would befit a student of Tarski. His Ph.D. dissertation, titled ''Contributions to the Axiomatic Foundations of Set Theory'',<ref>{{cite thesis |type=Ph.D. |last=Montague |first=Richard Merritt |date=June 1957 |title=Contributions to the axiomatic foundations of set theory |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |url=http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/record=b13106911~S1}}</ref> contained the first proof that all possible axiomatizations of the standard [[axiomatic set theory]] [[ZFC]] must contain infinitely many axioms. In other words, ZFC cannot be finitely axiomatized.

He pioneered a logical approach to natural language [[semantics]] which became known as [[Montague grammar]]. This approach to language has been especially influential among certain computational linguists—perhaps more so than among more traditional [[Philosophy of Language|philosophers of language]]. In particular, Montague's influence lives on in grammar approaches like categorial grammar (such as Unification Categorial Grammar, Left-Associate Grammar, or [[Combinatory categorial grammar|Combinatory Categorial Grammar]]), which attempt a derivation of syntactic and semantic representation in tandem and the semantics of quantifiers, scope and discourse (Hans Kamp, a student of Montague, co-developed Discourse Representation Theory).

Montague was an accomplished organist and a successful real estate investor. He died violently in his own home; the crime is unsolved to this day. Anita Feferman and Solomon Feferman argue that he usually went to bars "cruising" and bringing people home with him.<ref name="Feferman04">Feferman and Feferman 2004: 332-3</ref> On the day that he was murdered, he brought home several people "for some kind of soirée", but they instead robbed his house and strangled him.<ref name="Feferman04"/>
