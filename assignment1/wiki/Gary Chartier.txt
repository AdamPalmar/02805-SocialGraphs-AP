==Biography==

===Early years===
{{Anarchism sidebar}}
Chartier was born on December 30, 1966, in [[Glendale, California]], at what is now [[Glendale Adventist Medical Center]], to physician Stanley E. Chartier and Helen L. Bloodworth Chartier, later a realtor. His parents were socially conservative [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]]s; his physician father had previously worked as an accountant and had taught the subject at local colleges.<ref name=ChartierBio>Gary Chartier, "[http://liberalaw.blogspot.com/2009/08/getting-from-there-to-here-political.html Getting from There to Here]," ''LiberaLaw'' (np, Aug. 30, 2009).</ref> When Chartier was in high school he became interested in [[political theory]] after reading books by [[Robert Nozick]], [[Murray Rothbard]], [[Robert Anton Wilson]], and [[Friedrich Hayek]]. He appeared as a guest on [[Wally George]]'s ''[[Hot Seat (talk show)|Hot Seat]]'' television show in 1986 to defend an anarchist manifesto he submitted to the show's producers.<ref name=ChartierBio />

===College and graduate school===
Chartier received a [[bachelor's degree]] at what is now [[La Sierra University]] in 1987; he graduated ''magna cum laude'' and received the University President's Award. Though he had majored in history and political science, his undergraduate study of [[philosophy]] and [[religion]] led to his enrollment in a doctoral program in the [[philosophy of religion]] and [[theology]] at what was then [[Claremont Graduate School]]. While at Claremont, where he studied under [[John Hick]], he applied and was accepted into a PhD program in the [[Faculty of Divinity, Cambridge|Faculty of Divinity]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], where his teachers included [[Nicholas Lash]] and  Brian Hebblethwaite, and from which he was graduated in 1991. His dissertation, supervised by Hebblethwaite, focused on the idea of [[friendship]]; his examiners were [[Stephen R. L. Clark]] and  [[Michael Banner]]. By this time, his political views had taken a conventionally [[social democratic]] turn.<ref name=ChartierBio />

===Law school and La Sierra University faculty appointment===
After working as the editor of a newspaper in [[Temecula]], California, and of a journal published by La Sierra University, and teaching courses in religion and philosophy at [[Loma Linda University]] and [[California Baptist University]], Chartier enrolled at the [[UCLA School of Law]]. At UCLA, he studied with philosophers including Stephen R. Munzer,  [[Seana Shiffrin]], and [[Pamela Hieronymi]], with the political theorist Stephen Gardbaum, with former California Supreme Court Justice [[Cruz Reynoso]], and with constitutional law scholar Kenneth L. Karst; he graduated in 2001 as a member of the [[Order of the Coif]] and as the recipient of the Judge Jerry Pacht Memorial Award in [[Constitutional Law]]. He had served during law school as Lecturer in Business Ethics at La Sierra; a full-time academic appointment began in September 2001. Following a 2005 stint as Lecturer in Law at [[Brunel University]], Chartier was promoted to the rank of Associate [[Professor]] and [[tenured]] at La Sierra in 2008. He became Associate [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of La Sierra's [[business school]] in 2009; he was promoted to the rank of Professor in 2012.

===University of Cambridge recognition===
In 2015, the [[University of Cambridge]] presented Chartier with an earned [[Legum Doctor|LLD]] in recognition of his work in legal theory.<ref>See Darla Tucker, "[https://lasierra.edu/article/detail/News/business-prof-awarded-doctor-of-law-degree-by-university-of-cambridge/ Business prof awarded Doctor of Law degree by University of Cambridge]," La Sierra University, Dec. 17, 2015.</ref>

===Professional and community involvement===
Chartier serves as a member of the editorial board of the ''Libertarian Papers'',<ref>[http://libertarianpapers.org/editorial-board/ ''Libertarian Papers'': editorial board]</ref> as a member of the advisory board of and an article reviewer for the ''Journal of Philosophical Economics'',<ref>[http://www.jpe.ro/?id=b2 ''Journal of Philosophical Economics''; Advisory Board]</ref> as a trustee and senior fellow of the Center for a Stateless Society,<ref>[http://c4ss.org/content/author/garychartier C4SS: Gary Chartier]</ref> a contributor to [[Spectrum (magazine)|''Spectrum'']] magazine,<ref>[http://spectrummagazine.org/authors/gary-chartier ''Spectrum'': Contributors]</ref> and treasurer (formerly chair and Western Region vice-chair) of the [[Riverside County]] [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]].<ref>[http://www.rclp.org/officers.htm RCLP: Officers]</ref> He is a contributor to the ''Bleeding Heart Libertarians'' weblog; he has used the website to argue in favor of anarchy, and against having a criminal justice system.<ref>See Erik Kain, "[https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2011/08/21/criminal-justice-in-a-stateless-society/ Criminal Justice in a Stateless Society]," ''Forbes'', Aug. 21, 2011.</ref><ref>[http://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/author/gary-chartier/ Posts by Gary Chartier at ''Bleeding Heart Libertarians]; Also see: [[Bleeding-heart libertarianism]].</ref>

==Intellectual development==
Chartier had abandoned his earlier libertarian views by the time he entered graduate school. Despite his support for the anti-authoritarian [[New Left]] and the fact that his doctoral dissertation had called for radical political decentralization,<ref>Gary Chartier, "Toward a Theology and Ethics of Friendship" (PhD diss., U of Cambridge 1991) ch. 4.</ref> his earlier work in political theory was, perhaps somewhat inconsistently, [[Statism|statist]].<ref>See, ''e.g.'', Gary Chartier, "Peoples or Persons? Revising Rawls on Global Justice," ''Boston College International and Comparative Law Review'' 27.1 (Winter 2004): 1–97; "A Progressive Case for a Universal Transaction Tax," ''Maine Law Review'' 58.1 (2006): 1–16; ''The Analogy of Love: Divine and Human Love at the Center of Christian Theology'' (Exeter: Imprint Academic 2007) 126-8.</ref> It assumed, without criticism, that remedying poverty and reducing subordination, especially in the workplace, required the activity of the state.

By contrast, Chartier's current work in political theory is [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] and [[anarchist]] in flavor. His return to his [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] roots reflects the impact of his encounters with the thought of contemporary [[left-libertarians]] [[Kevin Carson]], [[Roderick T. Long]], and Charles Johnson, as well as a renewed appreciation for [[Stephen R. L. Clark]]'s critique of state authority.<ref>See Stephen R. L. Clark, ''Civil Peace and Sacred Order'', Limits and Renewals 1 (Oxford: Clarendon-OUP 1989); "Slaves and Citizens" and "Anarchists against the Revolution," ''The Political Animal: Biology, Ethics, Politics'' (London: Routledge 1999).</ref> Carson's work, in particular, provided a model for Chartier's reconciliation of his leftist politics with opposition to the state, and helped him to frame a version of [[left-libertarian]] [[market anarchism]] informed by insights from a version of [[natural law]] theory.<ref name=ChartierBio />

===Moral, political, and legal philosophy===

====General themes====
Chartier defends a variant of natural law thinking, which he has employed in discussions of anarchism, economic life,<ref>See Gary Chartier, ''Economic Justice and Natural Law'' (Cambridge: CUP 2009). This book is principally an exercise in [[applied ethics]], in which differences from other natural law views are more described than defended; it nonetheless addresses some more fundamental theoretical issues. These include the differences between natural law views and others regarding the character of [[practical reason]] and the limits of the arguments offered by other natural law theorists regarding the authority of the [[Sovereign state|state]].</ref> and the moral status and claims of non-human animals, as well as such other topics as [[Human sexuality|sexuality]]<ref>"Natural Law, Same-Sex Marriage, and the Politics of Virtue," ''UCLA Law Review'' 48.6 (Aug. 2001): 1593–1632.</ref> and [[Lie|lying]].<ref>See "Toward a Consistent Natural Law Ethics of False Assertion," ''American Journal of Jurisprudence'' 51 (2006): 43–64; "Self-Integration as a Basic Good: A Response to Chris Tollefsen," ''American Journal of Jurisprudence'' 52 (2007: 293–6)</ref>

{{Libertarianism sidebar}}

====Property and economic life====
Chartier offers an understanding of [[property rights]] as contingent but tightly constrained social strategies—reflective of the importance of multiple, overlapping rationales for separate [[ownership]] and of natural law principles of practical reasonableness, defending robust but non-absolute protections for these rights in a manner similar to that employed by [[David Hume]].<ref>See Gary Chartier, ''Anarchy and Legal Order: Law and Politics for a Stateless Society'' (New York: Cambridge UP 2013) 44-156.</ref> This account is distinguished both from [[Lockean]] and neo-Lockean views which deduce property rights from the idea of self-ownership and from [[consequentialist]] accounts that might license widespread ''ad hoc'' interference with the possessions of groups and individuals.<ref>See Gary Chartier, "Natural Law and Non-Aggression," ''Acta Juridica Hungarica'' 51.2 (June 2010): 79–96 and, for an earlier version, ''Justice'' 32–46.</ref> Chartier uses this account to ground a clear statement of the [[natural law]] basis for the view that solidaristic wealth [[redistribution (economics)|redistribution]] by individual persons is often morally required, but as a response by individuals and grass-roots networks to particular circumstances rather than as a state-driven attempt to achieve a particular distributive pattern.<ref>See ''Justice'' 47–68.</ref> He advances detailed arguments for [[workplace democracy]] rooted in such natural law principles as [[subsidiarity]],<ref>''Justice'' 89–120.</ref> defending it as morally desirable and as a likely outcome of the elimination of injustice rather than as something to be mandated by the state.<ref>See Gary Chartier, "Pirate Constitutions and Workplace Democracy," ''Jahrbuch für Recht und Ethik'' 18 (2010): 449–67.</ref> He discusses natural law approaches to [[land reform]] and to the [[occupation of factories]] by workers.<ref>''Justice'' 123-54.</ref> He objects on natural-law grounds to intellectual property protections, drawing on his theory of property rights more generally.<ref>See Gary Chartier,' "Intellectual Property and Natural Law," ''Australian Journal of Legal Philosophy'' 36 (2011): 58–88.</ref> And he develops a general natural law account of [[boycotts]].<ref>See ''Justice'' 176-82.</ref>

====Anarchism====
Chartier identifies himself as a "[[left-wing]] [[market anarchist]]."<ref>Chartier offers this self-description in his [http://www.blogger.com/profile/05687278491211390956 Blogger profile].</ref> His approach to [[market anarchism]] reflects his indebtedness to [[Kevin Carson]]'s [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]], the new classical [[natural law]] theory elaborated by [[Germain Grisez]] and [[John Finnis]], the "anarcho-conservatism" of [[Stephen R. L. Clark]], the [[New Left]]-influenced [[Left libertarian#Radical free-marketeers|left-libertarian]] [[decentralism]] of [[Karl Hess]],<ref>For Hess's left-libertarian decentralism, see Karl Hess, ''Dear America'' (New York: Morrow 1975). Re. Chartier as left-libertarian, compare, for instance, blogger TGGP's [http://entitledtoanopinion.wordpress.com/2009/12/26/the-john-birch-society-was-right/#comment-5165 claim] that "there are plenty of people on the left I would consider unquestionably libertarian. Left-libertarians like [[Kevin Carson]], [[Roderick T. Long|Roderick Long]], Charles Johnson, Gary Chartier, [[Sheldon Richman]] and so on."</ref> and the [[socialism]] and [[individualist anarchism]] of [[Benjamin Tucker]].<ref>For Tucker's account of the two as compatible, see [http://praxeology.net/BT-SSA.htm "State Socialism and Anarchism: How Far They Agree and Wherein They Differ,"] ''Instead of a Book: By a Man Too Busy to Write One'' (New York: Tucker 1897). Cp. Brad Spangler, [http://bradspangler.com/blog/archives/473 "Market Anarchism as Stigmergic Socialism"] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20110510102306/http://bradspangler.com/blog/archives/473 |date=May 10, 2011 }}; Gary Chartier, [http://liberalaw.blogspot.com/2009/06/socialism-revisited.html "Socialism Revisited."]</ref>

Chartier argues for anarchism on the basis that the state is unnecessary, illegitimate, and dangerous, and that the elimination of the state will unleash human creativity.<ref>See Chartier, ''Anarchy'' 157-241; Gary Chartier, ''The Conscience of an Anarchist: Why It's Time to Say Good-Bye to the State and Build a Free Society'' (Apple Valley, CA: Cobden 2011).</ref> His affinity for anarchism differentiates him from other proponents of natural-law ethics. Natural law theorists from St. Thomas [[Aquinas]] to the present have frequently been statists. They have often rejected consent-based theories of state authority as unrealistic, arguing instead, in a manner similar to [[David Hume]]'s, that actually existing states deserve allegiance because of their capacity to preserve order. Chartier contends that the state is not needed to maintain social order, and that natural law theorists need not be attached to it in preference to other means of maintaining order, including [[Norm (sociology)|custom]], [[Convention (norm)|convention]], and various voluntary arrangements.<ref>''Justice'' 26-9.</ref> He has also linked his concerns with [[anarchism]] and [[natural law]] theory indirectly by defending anarchism against objections levelled by natural law theorist Mark C. Murphy. Murphy has maintained that all arguments for "[[philosophical anarchism]]" fail because they misconstrue the nature of many people's support for the authority of state-made law and that people who believe in the authority of state-made law are entitled to retain their beliefs in the face of anarchist criticism. Chartier argues in response that for many people, at least, belief in state authority is defeasible and can rightly be undermined by positive arguments against particular justifications for the authority of state-made law.<ref>"In Defence of the Anarchist," ''Oxford Journal of Legal Studies'' 29.1 (2009): 115–38.</ref> Also important to his defense of anarchism is his detailed justification for the conclusion that, appearances to the contrary notwithstanding, the institutions of a consensual, polycentric legal order can enforce the law without becoming morally indistinguishable from states.<ref>Gary Chartier, "Enforcing the Law and Being a State," ''Law and Philosophy'' 31.1 (2012): 99–123.</ref> Even in ''Economic Justice and Natural Law'', which is not concerned particularly with [[anarchism]], he explicitly challenges the necessity of the [[Sovereign state|state]], and his discussion of ''law'' in a natural law context focuses on "communal norms, rules, and institutions"—which need not be maintained using force and which are intended to be understood as elements of a [[polycentric law|polycentric legal order]]—rather than on state-made laws.<ref>Chartier clearly intends ''Economic Justice and Natural Law'' to be read as an anarchist text; see Gary Chartier, "[http://liberalaw.blogspot.com/2009/09/anarchist-text.html An Anarchist Text?]" For the brief challenge to state authority in the book, see ''Justice'' 26-9. Chartier's [[Thomist]] view that multiple possible property systems might (within tight constraints) be just allows for a broader range of property rules than, ''e.g.'', many modern Lockeans might find appropriate; see, ''e.g.'', ''Justice'' 32–46, 69–122.</ref>

===="Capitalism" and "freed markets"====
Chartier has been an active participant in discussions among [[market anarchists]] and others about the aptness of "capitalism" as a label for what some participants in the conversation have termed "freed markets"in order to distinguish them from existing economic arrangements, which they see as shot through with statist privilege.<ref>For this phrase, see William Gillis, [http://williamgillis.blogspot.com/2007/07/freed-market-one-of-tactics-ive-taken.html (The Freed Market)].</ref> He has argued that proponents of genuinely freed markets should explicitly reject [[capitalism]] and identify with the global anti-capitalist movement, while emphasizing that the abuses the [[anti-capitalist]] movement highlights result from state-tolerated violence and state-secured privilege rather than from voluntary cooperation and exchange. According to Chartier, "it makes sense for [left-libertarians] to name what they oppose 'capitalism.' Doing so . . . ensures that advocates of freedom aren't confused with people who use market rhetoric to prop up an unjust status quo, and expresses solidarity between defenders of freed markets and workers—as well as ordinary people around the world who use 'capitalism' as a short-hand label for the world-system that constrains their freedom and stunts their lives."<ref>[[Sheldon Richman]], "[http://www.amconmag.com/blog/libertarian-left/ Libertarian Left: Free-Market Anti-Capitalism, the Unknown Ideal]," ''[[The American Conservative]]'' 10.3 (March 2011): 28-32.</ref> He has joined [[Kevin Carson]], Charles Johnson, and others (echoing the language of [[Benjamin Tucker]] and [[Thomas Hodgskin]]) in maintaining that, because of its heritage and its emancipatory goals and potential, radical market anarchism should be seen—by its proponents and by others—as part of the [[socialist]] tradition, and that market anarchists can and should call themselves "socialists."<ref>See Gary Chartier, "Advocates of Freed Markets Should Oppose Capitalism," "Free-Market Anti-Capitalism?" session, annual conference, [[Association of Private Enterprise Education]] (Cæsar's Palace, Las Vegas, NV, April 13, 2010); Gary Chartier, [http://c4ss.org/content/1738 "Advocates of Freed Markets Should Embrace 'Anti-Capitalism'"]; Gary Chartier, [http://invisiblemolotov.wordpress.com/2009/09/12/socialist-ends-market-means/ ''Socialist Ends, Market Means: Five Essays'']. Cp. Tucker, "Socialism."</ref>

====Non-human animals====
While supporting vegetarianism and affirming that non-human animals have moral standing,<ref>See, ''e.g.'', Gary Chartier, "Natural Law and Animal Rights," ''Canadian Journal of Law and Jurisprudence'' 23.1 (2010): 33–46.</ref> Chartier follows [[Stephen R. L. Clark]] in rejecting consequentialist defenses of [[vegetarianism]] like those offered by [[Peter Singer]].<ref>See the discussion of [[consequentialism]] and meat purchases in Gary Chartier, "Consumers, Boycotts, and Non-Human Animals," ''Buffalo Environmental Law Journal'' 12 (Spring 2005): 123–94. Singer's own position is articulated in Peter Singer, ''Animal Liberation: A New Ethics for Our Treatment of Animals'', 2d ed. (London: Cape 1990); Peter Singer, ''Practical Ethics'', 2d ed. (Cambridge: CUP 1993) 55–63. For Clark's rejection of consequentialist arguments for the vegetarian position he himself endorses, see Stephen R. L. Clark, ''The Moral Status of Animals'', 2d ed. (Oxford: Clarendon-OUP 1984) x–xi; Stephen R. L. Clark, "Vegetarianism and the Ethics of Virtue," ''Food for Thought: The Debate over Eating Meat'', ed. Stephen F. Sapontzis (Buffalo, NY: Prometheus 2004) 139, 146; Stephen R. L. Clark, ''Animals and Their Moral Standing'' (London: Routledge 1998) 100.</ref> Singer acknowledges that, on consequentialist grounds, it might seem as if there is little reason for individuals to be concerned about their dietary choices, since few of those choices will actually have consequences for any actual animals. But Singer maintains that some few dietary choices will, by crossing certain demand thresholds, dramatically increase production of animals for food and that taking this possibility into account provides good reason to avoid purchasing meat, since there is a small chance that a single meat purchase might lead to substantial negative consequences for many animals.<ref>[[Peter Singer]], "[[Utilitarianism]] and [[Vegetarianism]]," ''[[Philosophy and Public Affairs]]'' 9 (1980): 335.</ref> Chartier dissects Singer's argument, maintaining that it is unsuccessful because it fails to take proper account of the actual characteristics of the meat production market (or any similarly enormous market). He examines in detail consequentialist, natural law, and virtue theoretic accounts of boycotting the meat industry, concluding that both natural law and [[virtue theory]] provide limited grounds on which a boycott might be defended, but that consequentialism does not. While he maintains, in tandem with the new classical natural law theorists, that consequentialism is in principle incoherent, he also challenges the factual predictions made by consequentialist proponents of the meat industry boycott.<ref>See Gary Chartier, "On the Threshold Argument against Consumer Meat Purchases," ''Journal of Social Philosophy'' 37.2 (Sum. 2006): 235–51.</ref>

===Philosophy of religion and philosophical theology===

====General topics====
Chartier's work in the philosophy of religion and philosophical theology has focused especially on theodicy and divine action, but he has also addressed a range of other topics, including the significance of talk about God as personal, Christology, the relationship between God and ethics, and the idea of substitutionary atonement.

====The meaning of God-language====
Chartier has offered a reading of language about [[Personal god|God as personal]] that partly parallels logical [[behaviorist]] interpretations of talk about consciousness. He suggests that, because we cannot pretend to know what [[God]] is like ''in se'', this sort of reading, while inappropriate when applied to finite persons, could be helpful when used in relation to God.<ref>''Analogy'' 52-5.</ref>

====Divine action and theodicy====
He suggests that talk about divine action provides a necessary starting point for theological reflection, and argues that the only reasonable way to think about divine action, in turn, is to begin by considering the constraints on credible talk about [[divine providence]] imposed by the reality of suffering and evil.<ref>For the latter point, see ''Analogy'' 39.</ref> Reviewing a range of options in [[theodicy]], he concludes that, while their underlying assumptions (and accounts of creation) are different, classical [[free will]] [[theism]] and [[process theology]] lead to very similar predictions regarding what kinds of divine action are to be expected, and that, in connection with the task of constructive theology, there is therefore no need to choose between them,<ref>''Analogy'' 39–49.</ref> though the differences continue to matter with respect to questions in the philosophy of religion and philosophical theology.

When he does directly address questions related to [[theodicy]], he implies that [[process philosophy]] offers a more satisfactory theodicy than any alternative approach to theism, but he argues that even the process approach has significant difficulty taking proper account of the reality of animal suffering.<ref>"Non-Human Animals and Process Theodicy," ''[[Religious Studies (journal)|Religious Studies]]'' 42.1 (2006): 3–26.</ref> He maintains that Christian attempts to use the [[Incarnation]] as a component of theodicy are rendered problematic by the need to articulate belief in incarnational Christology using a robust account of divine action, which seems likely itself to make it harder to resolve the problem of evil (if God is in the business of working miracles, as such a robust view implies, why aren't there more of them?).<ref>See "The Incarnation and the Problem of Evil," ''Heythrop Journal'' 49 (2008): 110–27.</ref>

====Theism and ethics====
Chartier argues that [[divine command]] views of [[ethics]] turn out to be inconsistent with talk about God's love for the world. Talk about love in this context is meaningful only if some intelligible sense can be given to the notion of the beloved's well being that is independent of the choice of the lover, so the [[theist]] cannot maintain that God is love without acknowledging that some objective sense can be given to the notion of creaturely flourishing apart from God's will. The range of reasonable moral principles is constrained by facts about flourishing, and basic moral norms seem credible independently of the divine volition. And imposing obligations over and above those following from these principles would itself be an unloving thing to do.<ref>''Analogy'' 112-21.</ref>

====Atonement====
Criticizing [[substitutionary atonement|substitutionary]] accounts of [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]], Chartier notes that such theories purport to be committed to belief in [[retributive justice]], and thus fall victim to standard objections to retributivism. At the same time, however, by allowing for substituted [[punishment]], they imply a view of justice unlikely to be satisfactory to retributivists themselves.<ref>''Analogy'' 213-6.</ref>

==Publications==
Chartier is the author of seven scholarly books—''The Logic of Commitment'', ''Public Practice, Private Law'', ''Anarchy and Legal Order'', ''Radicalizing Rawls'', ''Economic Justice and Natural Law'',<ref name="Chartier2009">{{cite book|author=Gary Chartier|title=Economic Justice and Natural Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xt14iCgzENUC|date=6 August 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-76720-0}}</ref> ''The Analogy of Love'', and ''The Conscience of an Anarchist''—and of articles in journals including the ''Oxford Journal of Legal Studies'', ''Law and Philosophy'', ''Legal Theory'', the ''UCLA Law Review'', and ''[[Religious Studies (journal)|Religious Studies]]'', and the co-editor (with Charles Johnson) of ''Markets Not Capitalism''.

===Reactions to publications===
[[David Gordon (philosopher)|David Gordon]] praised ''Radicalizing Rawls'': "Chartier has written a book of outstanding merit. ''Radicalizing Rawls'' confirms his place as one of the best political philosophers of our time."<ref>David Gordon, "[https://mises.org/library/john-rawls-and-market-anarchy John Rawls and Market Anarchy]," ''Mises Review'' (Ludwig von Mises Institute, March 9, 2014).</ref>

Reactions to ''Anarchy and Legal Order'' have been mixed, though frequently positive.

Reviewing the book in ''Common Knowledge'', [[Peter Leeson]] described it as "intriguing" and classed it "among the most sophisticated ethical defenses of anarchy I have encountered."<ref>Peter T. Leeson, rev. of ''Anarchy and Legal Order: Law and Politics for a Stateless Society'', by Gary Chartier, ''Common Knowledge'' 20.3 (2014): 505.</ref> In ''Anarchist Studies'', Eric Roark wrote: "Gary Chartier’s ''Anarchy and Legal Order'' offers nothing less than a tremendous contribution to contemporary libertarian and anarchist thought." Roark highlighted what he characterized as a "compelling and rich vision of anarchy forged by a just legal regime."<ref>Eric Roark, rev. of ''Anarchy and Legal Order: Law and Politics for a Stateless Society'', by Gary Chartier, ''Anarchist Studies'' 21.2 (2013): 106-7.</ref> Edward Stringham characterized the book as "well written, thought provoking, and a welcome addition to the literature."<ref>Edward P. Stringham, rev. of ''Anarchy and Legal Order: Law and Politics for a Stateless Society'', by Gary Chartier, ''Public Choice'' 159.3-4 (2014): 583.</ref>

Aeon Skoble of Bridgewater State University suggested in a ''Reason'' review that Chartier’s "arguments [in the book] are laid out with such elegance and precision that any intelligent lay reader should be able to understand them." Skoble writes: "''Anarchy and Legal Order'' is an impressive contribution to libertarian thought generally, and in particular to the ongoing debates on anarchism versus minarchism and on libertarianism's place vis-a-vis the left/right dichotomy. It's a must-read for those interested in political philosophy, and it may well challenge readers' long-held beliefs about the nature of government.”<ref>Aeon J. Skoble, "[http://reason.com/archives/2013/03/22/is-anarchism-socialist-or-capitalist Is Anarchism Socialist or Capitalist?]," rev. of ''Anarchy and Legal Order: Law and Politics for a Stateless Society'', by Gary Chartier, ''Reason’’ (Reason Foundation, April 2013).
</ref> In a symposium in ''Studies in Emergent Order'' devoted to the book, Skoble added: "Chartier's argument demonstrates not only that natural law theory is compatible with spontaneous order theory, but also that what this confluence points to is a voluntary, polycentric legal order. The book is thus valuable not only for offering a robust defense of polycentrism, but for doing so in a way that ties together two important threads from the liberal tradition, natural law and spontaneous order, and in doing so, enhances our understanding of both.”<ref>Aeon J.

Austrian scholars of all persuasions will benefit immensely from engaging with its arguments and the intellectual precedent it creates."<ref>Paul Dragos Aligica, rev. of ''Anarchy and Legal Order: Law and Politics for a Stateless Society'', by Gary Chartier, ''Review of Austrian Economics'' 26.2 (June 2013): 41.</ref>

[http://www.law.uq.edu.au/academic-staff/staff.php?nm=jonathancrowe&tab=profilelink Jonathan Crowe] called ''Economic Justice and Natural Law'' "important and original." [http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/philos/chappell.htm Timothy Chappell] declared that it was "[e]ssential reading" and maintained that it was "elegant, clear, and well-informed." According to [http://www.law.ucla.edu/home/index.asp?page=627 Stephen Munzer], it was "perceptive, timely, and beautifully ordered" and featured arguments that were "probing and trenchant."<ref>[http://www.cambridge.org/uk/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521767200 ''Economic Justice and Natural Law'' cover blurbs.]</ref> By contrast, St. John’s University economist [[Charles Clarke]] criticized the book’s anarchism, evaluating it as insufficiently attentive to the need for governmental involvement in the economy and as unduly similar in tone to the work of [[Austrian School|Austrian economists]].<ref>See Charles Clark, rev. of ''Economic Justice and Natural Law'', by Gary Chartier, ''Conversations in Religion and Theology'' 9.2 (Nov. 2011): 179-87.</ref> The book was the focus of a [[Gustave de Molinari|Molinari]] Society session at the April 2011 [[San Diego]] convention of the [[American Philosophical Association]]'s Pacific Division.<ref>The session was chaired by [[Roderick T. Long]]. The commentators were [[David Gordon (philosopher)|David Gordon]], [[Douglas Rasmussen]], [[Douglas Den Uyl]], Jennifer Baker, and [[Kevin Carson]]. For details, see the Molinari Society's description of the program [http://praxeology.net/molinarisoc.htm#programs here].</ref>

''The Analogy of Love'' received mixed reviews. In the course of a tepidly favorable assessment, [[Timothy Gorringe]] maintained that some passages disposed him to "reach for the whiskey bottle," though he also observed that the book did "not parade its erudition" and suggested that it was "consistently on the side of the angels."<ref>Timothy Gorringe, rev. of ''The Analogy of Love'', by Gary Chartier, ''Theology'', Sep.-Oct 2008: 384–5.</ref> By contrast, [[Ian Markham]] characterized the book as "a rare treat," labelling it "[c]ompelling, well-argued, crystal clear and deeply creative" and identifying it as "[a]n absolute must-read."<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1845400917 ''Analogy of Love'' cover blurb.]</ref> Paul Ballard described ''Analogy'' as "extremely well informed and researched," as "comprehensive," and as "rich, sensitive and insightful." Ballard evaluated the book's "style of presentation" as "remarkably lucid and jargon free" and as "spare, simple, direct and logical, cutting to the heart of a discussion." <ref>See Paul Ballard, rev. of ''The Analogy of Love'', by Gary Chartier, ''Theological Book Review'' 20.1 (2008): 54–5.</ref>

[[Stephan Kinsella]] has described Chartier's third book as "the best of the crop of political 'conscience' books."<ref>Kinsella’s comments appear as a jacket endorsement on the back cover of the book. For an earlier version, see Stephan Kinsella, "[http://www.stephankinsella.com/2009/08/22/chartiers-conscience-of-an-anarchist/ Chartier's ''Conscience of an Anarchist'']." The title is a reference to such earlier works as [[Barry Goldwater]]'s ''[[The Conscience of a Conservative]]'', [[Paul Krugman]]'s ''[[The Conscience of a Liberal]]'', [[Zell Miller]]'s ''A National Party No More: The Conscience of a Conservative Democrat'', and [[Wayne Allyn Root]]'s ''The Conscience of a Libertarian''.</ref> Jeff Riggenbach maintains that "[l]ibertarians who are now in their teens and twenties could do far worse than to let their own attention be captured by Gary Chartier's ''Conscience of an Anarchist''."<ref>Jeff Riggenbach, "[https://mises.org/daily/5355/The-Anarchist-Conscience The Anarchist Conscience]," ''Mises Daily'' (Ludwig von Mises Institute, June 10, 2011).</ref> According to Aeon Skoble, "Chartier’s arguments are logically well structured and rhetorically effective. His writing style is clear and straightforward." Skoble emphasizes that "[p]eople with a background in philosophy or economics will find the arguments interesting and not simplistic, yet any intelligent lay reader will find the book accessible."<ref>Aeon J. Skoble, [http://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?a=873 rev. of ''The Conscience of an Anarchist'', by Gary Chartier], ''Independent Review'' 3.16 (Winter 2012): 472.</ref> Skoble says the book features "five chapters of convincing argument that the state causes terrible problems for no justifiable reason."<ref>Skoble 474.</ref>
