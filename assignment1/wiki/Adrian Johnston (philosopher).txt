'''Adrian Johnston''' is a Professor in the Department of Philosophy at the [[University of New Mexico]] at [[Albuquerque]] and a faculty member at the Emory Psychoanalytic Institute in [[Atlanta]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://philosophy.unm.edu/people/faculty/profile/adrian-johnston.html|title=Adrian Johnston|work=unm.edu|accessdate=3 March 2015}}</ref>

Johnston is one of the most widely followed philosophers writing today. Influenced by [[Slavoj Žižek|Žižek]] and his readings of [[German idealism]], Johnston’s work has gained many readers among those making the materialist and realist turns in [[Continental philosophy]].<ref name="societyandspace.com">{{cite web|url=http://societyandspace.org/2013/10/07/on-4/|title=Interview with Adrian Johnston on Transcendental Materialism|work=Society and space|accessdate=9 February 2017}}</ref> Johnston’s books are guided by his “transcendental materialism,” which in sum calls for a materialist ontology that nevertheless does not reduce away the gap or figure that is human subjectivity. Johnston argues for retooling [[Freud]] and [[Lacan]] after the success of the natural sciences in recent decades, but argues that both Freud and Lacan presaged a lot of these successes. Critical of the thinkers of immanence whom he believes, following [[Hegel]], can only give us subjectless substance, Johnston’s work has brought [[Lacanianism]] into the 21st century when many wrongly claimed it died long before the end of the last.<ref name="societyandspace.com"/>

Johnston is the author of ''Time Driven: Metapsychology and the Splitting of the Drive'' (2005), ''Žižek’s Ontology: A Transcendental Materialist Theory of Subjectivity'' (2008), ''Badiou, Žižek, and Political Transformations: The Cadence of Change'' (2009), and ''Prolegomena to Any Future Materialism, Volume One: The Outcome of contemporary French Philosophy'' (2013), all published by Northwestern University Press. He is the co-author, with [[Catherine Malabou]], of ''Self and Emotional Life: Philosophy, Psychoanalysis, and Neuroscience'' (Columbia University Press, 2013).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_0_14?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=adrian+johnston&sprefix=Adrian+Johnsto%2Caps%2C413|title=Amazon.com: adrian johnston: Books|work=amazon.com|accessdate=3 March 2015}}</ref>

Johnston's most recent book is ''Adventures in Transcendental Materialism: Dialogues with Contemporary Thinkers'' (Edinburgh University Press, 2014) with Todd McGowan and [[Slavoj Žižek]]. He is also a co-editor of the book series ''Diaeresis'' at Northwestern University Press.
