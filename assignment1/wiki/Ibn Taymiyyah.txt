== Name ==
Ibn Taymiyyah's full name is ''Taqī ad-Dīn Abu 'l-`Abbās Ahmad ibn `Abd al-Ḥalīm ibn `Abd as-Salām ibn ʿAbd Allāh ibn al-Khidr ibn Muhammad ibn al-Khidr ibn `Ali ibn ʿAbd Allāh ibn Taymiyyah al-Ḥarrānī''<ref name=":0" /> ({{lang-ar| تقي الدين أبو العباس أحمد بن عبد الحليم بن عبد السلام بن عبد الله بن الخضر بن محمد بن الخضر بن على بن عبد الله ابن تيمية الحراني}}).

Ibn Taymiyyah's name is unusual in that it is derived from a female member of his family as opposed to a male member, which was the normal custom at the time and still is now. Taimiyatu was a woman, famous for her scholarship and piety and the name Ibn Taymiyyah was taken up by many of her male descendents.<ref name=":0" />

== Overview ==
Ibn Taymiyyah had a simple life, most of which he dedicated to learning, writing, and teaching. He never married nor did he have a female companion, throughout his years.<ref name=":14" /><ref name=":13">{{cite book|title=Unholy War: Terror in the Name of Islam|last=Esposito|first=John L.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=0-19-516886-0|pages=45}}</ref> Al-Matroudi says that this may be why he was able to engage fully with the political affairs of his time without holding any official position such as that of a judge.<ref name=":16" /> An offer of an official position was made to him but he never accepted.<ref name=":16" /> His life was that of a religious scholar and a political activist.<ref name=":13" /> In his efforts he was persecuted and imprisoned on six different occasions<ref>{{cite book|title=Islam and the Secular State: Negotiating the Future of Shari`a|last=An-Na`im|first=Abdullahi Ahmed|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2010|isbn=0-674-03456-2|pages=76}}</ref> with the total time spent inside prison coming to over six years.<ref name=":13" /><ref name=":9" /> Other sources say that he spent over twelve years in prison.<ref name=":16">{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t349/e0108|title=Ibn Taymīyah, Taqī al-Dīn Aḥmad |date=2015-02-14|accessdate=February 14, 2015 |publisher=Oxford University Press|last=Al-Matroudi|first=Abdul-Hakim}}</ref> His detentions were due to certain elements of his creed and his views on some jurisprudential issues.<ref name=":14" /> However according to Yahya Michot, "the real reasons were more trivial". Michot gives five reasons as to why Ibn Taymiyyah was imprisoned, they being: not complying with the "doctrines and practices prevalent among powerful religious and Sufi establishments, an overly outspoken personality, the jealousy of his peers, the risk to public order due to this popular appeal and political intrigues."<ref name=":9" /> Baber Johansen, a professor at the Harvard divinity school says that the reasons for Ibn Taymiyyah's incarcerations were, "as a result of his conflicts with Muslim mystics, jurists, and theologians, who were able to persuade the political authorities of the necessity to limit Ibn Taymiyyah's range of action through political censorship and incarceration."<ref name=":7" />

Ibn Taymiyyah's own relationship, as a religious scholar, with the ruling apparatus, who did deviate in application of shari'a law, was not always amicable.<ref name=":9" /> It ranged from silence to open rebellion.<ref name=":9" /> On occasions when he shared the same views and aims as the ruling authorities, his contributions were welcomed but when Ibn Taymiyyah went against the status quo, he was seen as "uncooperative" and on occasions spent much time in prison.<ref name=":3" /> Ibn Taymiyyah's attitude towards his own rulers, was based on the actions of the companions (sahaba) when they made an oath of allegiance to Muhammad as follows; "to obey within obedience to God, even if the one giving the order is unjust; to abstain from disputing the authority of those who exert it; and to speak out the truth, or take up its cause without fear in respect of God, of blame from anyone."<ref name=":9" />

== Early years ==
=== Background ===
Ibn Taymiyyah was born in 1263 in [[Harran]] into a well-known family of theologians, to an [[Arab people|Arab]] father and a [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] mother.<ref>Khwaja Khusro Tariq, ''[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/khwaja-khusro-tariq/ibn-taymiyyah-and-the-syn_b_10096820.html Lessons From Islamic History: Ibn Taymiyyah and the Synthesis of Takfir]'', [[HuffPost]], 31 May 2016</ref> His father had the Hanbali chair in Harran and later at the Great mosque of Damascus ([[Umayyad Mosque]]). Harran was a city part of the [[Sultanate of Rum]], now Harran is a small city on the border of [[Syria]] and Turkey, currently in [[Şanlıurfa Province|Şanlıurfa province]], a place to which Moses was reportedly sent to provide guidance.<ref name=":1" /> Before its [[Mongol invasions of Anatolia|destruction by the Mongols]], Harran was also well known since the early days of Islam for its [[Hanbalism|Hanbali]] school and tradition,<ref>{{cite book|title=Tadhkirat al-huffaz|last=Al-Dhahabi|first=Muhammad ibn Ahmad |location=Haidarabad|pages=48}}</ref> to which Ibn Taymiyyah's family belonged.<ref name=":1">{{cite book|title=Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics|last=Hastings|first=James|publisher=Morrison and Gibb Limited|year=1908 |pages=72|volume=Volume;7}}</ref> His grandfather, Abu al-Barkat Majd ad-Din ibn Taymiyyah al-Hanbali (d. 1255) and his uncle, Fakhr al-Din (d. 1225) were reputable scholars of the [[Hanbali]] [[Madh'hab|school of law]].<ref name=":2">{{cite web|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/ibn-taymiyya-SIM_3388|title="Ibn Taymiyya."

Ernst and Richard C. Martin, Ibn Taymiyyah believed, non-[[Arab]] Muslims are inferior to [[Arab]] Muslims.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ernst, Martin|first1=Carl W., Richard C.|title=Rethinking Islamic Studies: From Orientalism to Cosmopolitanism|url=https://books.google.com.tr/books?id=YjoMCAAAQBAJ&pg=PT137&dq=ibn+taymiyyah+arab+superiority&hl=tr&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjj4tbH1erJAhXEgg8KHb7_CzkQ6AEIJDAB#v=onepage&q=ibn%20taymiyyah%20arab%20superiority&f=false}}</ref>

=== Immigration to Damascus ===
In 1269, Ibn Taymiyyah at the age of seven together with his father, and three brothers left the city of Harran which was completely destroyed by the ensuing Mongol invasion.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=6}}<ref name=":2" /> Ibn Taymiyyah's family moved and settled in [[Damascus]], [[Syria]], which at the time was ruled by the [[Mamluk]]s of [[Egypt]].

=== Education ===
In Damascus his father served as the director of the Sukkariyya madrasa, a place where Ibn Taymiyyah also received his early education.<ref name=":4">{{cite book|title=Studia missionalia|last=Michel|first=Thomas|publisher=Pontificia Università Gregorian|year=1985 |location=Rome, Italy |volume=Volume 34|chapter=Ibn Taymiyya: Islamic Reformer}}</ref> Ibn Taymiyyah acquainted himself with the [[Science in medieval Islam|religious and secular sciences]] of his time. His religious studies began in his early teens, when he committed the entire Qur'an to memory and later on came to learn the Islamic disciplines of the Qur'an.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=6}} From his father he learnt the religious science of [[Fiqh]] (jurisprudence) and [[Usul al-Fiqh]] (principles of jurisprudence).{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=6}} Ibn Taymiyyah learnt the works of [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]], [[Abu Bakr al-Khallal|al-Khallal]], [[Ibn Qudamah]] and also the works of his grandfather, Abu al-Barakat Majd ad-Din.<ref name=":2" /> His study of jurisprudence was not limited to the Hanbali tradition but he also learnt the other schools of jurisprudence.<ref name=":2" />

The number of scholars under which he studied [[Hadith]] is said to number more than two hundred,<ref name=":14" />{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=6}}<ref>{{cite book|title=Al-'Uqud ad-Dariat|last=Al-Dimashqi al-Hanbali |first =Ibn `Abdul-Hadi |pages=3}}</ref> four of whom were women.<ref>{{cite book|title=Shadharat al-Dhahab|last=Al-Hanbali|first=Ibn al-`Imad |year=1932 |location=Cairo|pages=385, 383, 404}}</ref> Those who are known by name amount to forty hadith teachers, as recorded by Ibn Taymiyyah in his book called ''Arba`un Hadithan''.{{sfn|Haque|1982|pp=38–44}} Serajul Haque says, based on this, Ibn Taymiyyah started to hear hadith from the age of five.{{sfn|Haque|1982|pp=38–44}} One of his teachers was the first Hanbali Chief Justice of Syria, Shams ud-Din Al-Maqdisi who held the newly created position instituted by [[Baibars]] as part of a reform of the judiciary.<ref name=":2" /> Al-Maqdisi later on, came to give Ibn Taymiyyah permission to issue Fatawa (legal verdicts) when he became a [[mufti]] at the age of 17.<ref name=":14" /><ref name=":9">{{cite book|title=The Princeton Encyclopedia of Islamic Political Thought|last=Michot|first=Yahya|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2012|isbn=0-691-13484-7 |pages=238–241}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Sharh Al-Aqeedat-il-Wasitiyah|last=Ibn Taimiya|first=Taqi ad-Din|publisher=Dar-us-Salam|year=1996 |pages=9}}</ref>

Ibn Taymiyyah's secular studies led him to devote attention to [[Arabic language]] and [[Arabic literature]] by studying Arabic grammar and [[lexicography]] under Ali ibn `Abd al-Qawi al-Tuft.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=6}}<ref name=":24">{{cite book|title=The Qur'an: An Encyclopedia|last=Leaman|first=Oliver|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=2006|isbn=0-415-32639-7 |pages=280–282}}</ref> He went on to master the famous book of Arabic grammar, Al-Kitab, by the Persian grammarian [[Sibawayhi]].{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=6}} He also studied mathematics, algebra, [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]], [[theology]] ([[Ilm al-Kalam|kalam]]), philosophy, history and heresiography.<ref name=":14" /><ref name=":9" /><ref name=":2" /><ref>see aqidatul-waasitiyyah daarussalaam publications</ref> The knowledge he gained from history and philosophy, he used to refute the prevalent philosopical discourses of his time, one of which was [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian philosophy]].<ref name=":14" /> Ibn Taymiyyah learnt about [[Sufism]] and stated that he had reflected on the works of; [[Sahl al-Tustari]], [[Junayd of Baghdad]], [[Abu Talib al-Makki]], [[Abdul-Qadir Gilani]], [[Abu Hafs Umar al-Suhrawardi]] and [[Ibn Arabi]].<ref name=":2" />  At the age of 20 in the year 1282, Ibn Taymiyyah completed his education.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=8}}

== Life as a scholar ==
[[File:Flickr - …trialsanderrors - Minaret of the Bride, Damascus, Holy Land, ca. 1895.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Umayyad Mosque, a place where Ibn Taimiyya used to give lessons.<ref name=":9" />]]
After his father died in 1284, he took up the then vacant post as the head of the Sukkariyya madrasa and began giving lessons on Hadith.<ref name=":9" /><ref name=":2" /><ref name=":17">{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t342/e0217|title="Ibn Taymīyah, Taqī al-Dīn Aḥmad."

The Hanbali school was seen as the most traditional school out of the four legal systems ([[Hanafi]], [[Maliki]] and [[Shafi'i|Shafii]]) because it was "suspicious of the [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenist]] disciplines of philosophy and [[Ilm al-Kalam|speculative theology]]."<ref name=":4" /> He remained faithful throughout his life to this school, whose doctrines he had mastered, but he nevertheless called for [[ijtihad]] (independent reasoning by one who is qualified) and discouraged taqlid.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=8}}

=== Relationship with authorities ===
Ibn Taymiyyah's emergence into the public and political sphere began in 1293 at the age of 30, when he was asked by the authorities to give an Islamic legal verdict (Fatwa) on Assaf al-Nasrani, a Christian cleric accused of insulting Muhammad.<ref name=":3">{{cite book|title=The Crusades: Islamic Perspectives|last=Hillenbrand|first=Carole|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=1999|isbn=0-7486-0630-0 |pages=242}}</ref><ref name=":2" /><ref>{{cite book|title=slam and Inter-Faith Relations: The Gerald Weisfeld Lectures 2006|last=Schmidt-Leukel|first=Perry|publisher=SCM Press|year=2007|isbn=0-334-04132-5 |pages=125}}</ref> He accepted the invitation and delivered his fatwa, calling for the man to receive the death penalty.<ref name=":3" /> Despite the fact that public opinion was very much on Ibn Taymiyyah's side,<ref name=":4" /> the Governor of Syria attempted to resolve the situation by asking Assaf to accept Islam in return for his life, to which he agreed.<ref name=":4" /> This resolution was not acceptable to Ibn Taymiyyah who then, together with his followers, protested outside the Governor's palace demanding Assaf be put to death,<ref name=":4" /> on the grounds that any person—Muslim or non-Muslim—who insults Muhammad must be killed.<ref name=":9" /><ref name=":4" /> This unwillingness to compromise coupled with his attempt to protest against the Governor's actions, resulted in him being punished with a prison sentence, the first of many such imprisonments to come.<ref name=":2" /> The French orientalist [[Henri Laoust]] says that during this incarceration Ibn Taymiyyah "wrote his first great work, ''al-Ṣārim al-maslūl ʿalā s̲h̲ātim al-Rasūl (The Drawn Sword against those who insult the Messenger).''"<ref name=":2" /> Ibn Taymiyyah, together with the help of his disciples, continued with his efforts against what, "he perceived to be un-Islamic practices" and to implement what he saw as his religious duty of commanding good and forbidding wrong.<ref name=":9" /><ref name=":19">{{cite book|title=Ibn Taymiyya and His Times|last=Rapoport|first=Yossef|publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2010 |isbn=0-19-547834-7 |last2=Ahmed |first2=Shahab|chapter=Introduction}}</ref> Yahya Michot says that some of these incidences included: "shaving children's heads", leading "an anti-debauchery campaign in brothels and taverns", hitting an atheist before his public execution, destroying what was thought to be a sacred rock in a mosque, attacking astrologers and obliging "deviant Sufi Shaykhs to make public acts of contrition and to adhere to the Sunnah."<ref name=":9" /> Ibn Taymiyyah and his disciples used to condemn wine sellers and they would attack wine shops in Damascus by breaking wine bottles and pouring them onto the floor.<ref name=":25">{{cite book|title=Ibn Taymiyya and His Times|last=Bori|first=Caterina|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=0-19-547834-7 |chapter=Ibn Taymiyya wa-Jama`atuhu: Authority, Conflict and Consensus in Ibn Taymiyya's Circle}}</ref>

A few years later in 1296, he took over the position of one of his teachers (Zayn al-Din Ibn al-Munadjdjaal), taking the post of professor of Hanbali jurisprudence at the Hanbaliyya madrasa, the oldest such institution of this tradition in Damascus.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":4" /><ref>{{cite book|title=State and Government in Medieval Islam: An Introduction to the Study of Islamic Political Theory|last=K.

In 1298 Ibn Taymiyyah wrote an explanation of the ayat al-mutashabihat (the unclear verses of the Qur'an) called Al-`Aqidat al-Hamawiyat al-Kubra (The creed of the great people of Hama).{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=9}}<ref name=":27">{{cite book|title=Islamic Philosophy and Theology|last=Watt|first=William Montgomery|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=2008|isbn=0-202-36272-8 |pages=160}}</ref> The book is about divine attributes and it served as an answer to a question from the city of [[Hama]], Syria.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=9}}<ref name=":27" /> At that particular time [[Ash'ari]]tes held prominent positions within the Islamic scholarly community in both Syria and Egypt, and they held a certain position on the divine attributes of God.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=9}} Ibn Taymiyyah in his book strongly disagreed with their views and this heavy opposition to the common Ash'ari position, caused considerable controversy.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=9}}

Ibn Taymiyyah collaborated once more with the Mamluks in 1300, when he joined the expedition against the [[Alawites]] , in the Kasrawan region of the [[Mount Lebanon|Lebanese mountains]].<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":2" /> Ibn Taymiyyah thought of the Alawites as "more heritical yet than Jews and Christians,"<ref name=":6">{{cite book|title=Everyday Jihad: The Rise of Militant Islam Among Palestinians in Lebanon|last=Rougier|first=Bernard|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2008|isbn=0-674-03066-4 |pages=162}}</ref> (بالنصيرية هم وسائر أصناف القرامطة الباطنية أكفر من اليهود والنصارى ; بل وأكفر من كثير من المشركين),<ref>Ibn Taymiyyah [Majmoo` al-Fatawa 35/145] [http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?flag=1&bk_no=22&ID=6111][https://archive.org/stream/mjftitdrwf/mft35#page/n89/mode/2up إبن تيمية مجموع الفتاوي ٣٥/١٤٥][https://shaykhulislaam.wordpress.com/2009/08/13/ruling-on-the-nusayrialawi-sect/ English translation of the Fatwa]</ref> and according to Carole Hillenbrand, the confrontation with the Shia's resulted because they "were accused of collaboration with Christians and Mongols."<ref name=":3" /> Ibn Taymiyya had further active involvements in campaigns against the Mongols and their Shia allies.<ref name=":4" />

[[File:Mongol raids into Syria and Palestine ca 1300.svg|thumb|300px|Mongol invasion of Syria]]

=== First invasions ===
The first invasion took place between December 1299 and April 1300 due to the military campaign by the Mamluks against the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia who were allied with the Mongols.<ref name=":18">{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/jhoover363/taymiyyan-studies/jihad-against-the-mongols|title=Taymiyyan Studies|date=|accessdate=February 14, 2015 |last=Hoover|first=Jon}}</ref> The Ilkhanate army managed to reach Damascus by the end of December 1299.<ref name=":18" /> Ibn Taymiyyah went with a delegation of Islamic scholars to talk to [[Ghazan]] Khan, who was the [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the Mongol [[Ilkhanate]] of Iran, to plead clemency<ref name=":18" /> and to stop his attack on the Muslims. It is reported that none of the scholars said anything to the Khan except Ibn Taymiyyah who said:<blockquote> "You claim that you are Muslim and you have with you [[Muezzin|Mu'adhdhins]], [[Mufti]]s, [[Imam]]s and [[Sheikh|Shaykhs]] but you invaded us and reached our country for what?

=== Second Mongol invasion ===
The second invasion lasted between October 1300 and January 1301.<ref name=":18" /> Ibn Taymiyyah at this time began giving sermons on Jihad at the Umayyad mosque.<ref name=":18" /> Ibn Taymiyyah also spoke to and encouraged the Governor of Damscus, al-Afram to achieve a victory against the Mongols.<ref name=":18" /> He became involved with al-Afram once more, when he was sent to get reinforcements from Cairo.<ref name=":18" />

Ibn Taymiyyah declared that jihad against the Mongol attack on the Malmuk sultanate was not only permissible, but [[Fard|obligatory]].<ref name=":17" /> The reason being that the Mongols could not, in his opinion, be true Muslims despite the fact that they had converted to Sunni Islam because they ruled using what he considered 'man-made laws' (their traditional [[Yassa]] code) rather than Islamic law or ''Sharia'', whilst believing that the Yassa code was better than the Sharia law.

Ibn Taymiyyah called on the Muslims to Jihad once again and he also personally joined the eventual [[Battle of Marj al-Saffar (1303)|battle of Marj al-Saffar]] against the Mongol army.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":5" /> The battle began on 20 April of that year.<ref name=":5" /> On the same day, Ibn Taymiyyah declared a fatwa which exempted Mamluk soldiers from the fast during the month of Ramadan so that they could maintain their strength.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":2" /><ref name=":5" /> Within two days the Mongols were severely defeated and the battle was won.<ref name=":5" />

== Facing charges against his literalism ==
Ibn Taymiyah was imprisoned several times for conflicting with the ''[[ijma]]'' of jurists and theologians of his day. From the city of [[Wasit, Iraq|Wasit]], [[Iraq]], a judge requested that Ibn Taymiyyah write a book on creed which led to him writing his book, for which he faced troubles, called ''[[Al-Aqidah Al-Waasitiyyah]], ''a work on'' ''his view of the [[ʿAqīdah|creed (`aqidah)]] of the salaf which included reference to the divine attributes of God.<ref name=":7" /><ref name=":24" /> Ibn Taymiyyah adopted the view that God should be described as he was literally described in the Qur'an and in the hadith,<ref name=":24" /> and that all Muslims were required to believe this because according to him it was the view held by the early Muslim community (salaf).<ref name=":7">{{cite book|title=The Law Applied: Contextualizing the Islamic Shari'a|last=Bearman|first=Peri|publisher=I.B.Tauris|year=2007|isbn=1-84511-736-0 |pages=263–264}}</ref> Within the space of two years (1305–1306) four separate religious council hearings were held to assess the correctness of his creed.<ref name=":7" />

=== 1305 hearing ===
The first hearing was held with the [[Shafi'i|Shafii]] scholars who accused Ibn Taymiyyah of [[anthropomorphism]].<ref name=":7" /> At the time Ibn Taymiyyah was 42 years old. He was protected by the then Governor of Damascus, Aqqush al-Afram, during the proceedings.<ref name=":7" /> The scholars suggested that he accept that his creed was simply that of the Hanbalites and offered this as a way out of the charge.<ref name=":7" /> The issue being, if Ibn Taymiyyah ascribed his creed to the Hanbali school of law then it would be just one view out of the four schools which one could follow rather than a creed everybody must adhere to.<ref name=":7" /> Ibn Taymiyyah was uncompromising and maintained that it was obligatory for all scholars to adhere to his creed.<ref name=":7" />

=== 1306 hearings and imprisonment ===
Two separate councils were held a year later on 22 and 28 of January 1306.<ref name=":7" /><ref name=":2" /> The first council was in the house of the Governor of Damascus Aqqush al-Afram, who had protected him the year before when facing the Shafii scholars.<ref name=":2" /> A second hearing was held six days later where the Indian scholar Safi al-Din al-Hindi found him innocent of all charges and accepted that his creed was in line with the "Qur'an and the Sunna".<ref name=":7" /><ref name=":2" /> Regardless, in April 1306 the chief Islamic judges of the Mamluk state declared Ibn Taymiyyah guilty and he was incarcerated.<ref name=":7" /> He was released four months later in September.<ref name=":7" />

=== Further objections after release ===
After his release in Damascus, the doubts regarding his creed seemed to have resolved but this was not the case.<ref name=":2" /> A Shafii scholar, Ibn al-Sarsari, was insistent on starting another hearing against Ibn Taymiyyah which was held once again at the house of the Governor of Damascus, Al-Afram.<ref name=":2" /> His book ''Al-Aqidah Al-Waasitiyyah'' was still not found at fault.<ref name=":2" /> At the conclusion of this hearing, Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn al-Sarsari were sent to Cairo to settle the problem.

== Life in Egypt ==
=== Debate on literalism and imprisonment ===
On arrival of Ibn Taymiyyah and the Shafi'ite scholar in Cairo in 1306, an open meeting was held.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=10}} The Sultan of Egypt at the time was [[Al-Nasir Muhammad]] and his deputy attended the open meeting.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=10}} Ibn Taymiyyah was found innocent.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=10}} Despite the open meeting, objections regarding his creed continued and he was summoned to the Citadel in Cairo for a Munazara (legal debate), which took place on 8 April 1306. During the Munazara his views on divine attributes, specifically whether a direction could be attributed to God, were debated by the Indian Scholar Safi al-Din al-Hindi, in the presence of Islamic judges.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=11}}<ref name=":2" /> Ibn Taymiyyah failed to convince the judges of his position and so on the recommendation of Al-Hindi was incarcerated for the charge of anthropomorphism.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=11}}<ref name=":2" /> Thereafter, he together with his two brothers were imprisoned in the Citadel of the mountain (Qal‘at al-Jabal), in Cairo until 25 September 1307.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=VII}}<ref name=":2" />{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=11}} He was freed due to the help he received from two Amirs (ruler or military ruler); Salar and [[Muhanna ibn Isa]], but he was not allowed to go back to Syria.<ref name=":2" /> He was then, again summoned for a legal debate but this time he convinced the judges of his views and he was allowed to go free.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=11}}

=== Trial for intercession and imprisonment ===
[[File:Porte de la citadelle et mosquee Mouhammed Aly.jpg|300px|thumb|left|[[Citadel of Cairo]], the place where Ibn Taymiyyah was imprisoned for 18 months]]
Ibn Taymiyyah continued to face troubles for his views which were found to be at odds with those of his contemporaries. His strong opposition to what he believed to be un-Islamic innovation ([[bid‘ah]]), caused upset among the prominent Sufis of Egypt including Ibn `Ata'Allah and Karim al-Din al-Amuli, and the locals who started to protest against Ibn Taymiyyah.<ref name=":2" /> The nature of the point under contention was Ibn Taymiyyah's stance on [[Tawassul|tawassul (intercession)]].<ref name=":2" /> In his view a person could not ask anyone other than God for help except on the day of judgement when intercession in his view would be possible. At the time, the people did not restrict intercession to just the day of judgement but rather they said it was allowed in other cases. Due to this Ibn Taymiyyah, now 45, was ordered to appear before the Shafii judge Badr al-Din in March 1308 and was questioned on his stance regarding intercession.<ref name=":2" /> Thereafter, he was incarcerated in the prison of the judges in Cairo for some months.<ref name=":2" /> After his release, he was allowed to return to Syria, should he so wish.<ref name=":2" /> Ibn Taymiyyah however stayed in Egypt for a further 5 years.

=== House arrest in Alexandria ===
The year after his release in 1309 saw a change of power to a new Sultan in Egypt, [[Baibars II|Baibars al-Jashnakir]] whose reign was marked by economical and political unrest.<ref name=":2" /> His hold on power was short lived and lasted only a year. During this time, in August 1309, Ibn Taymiyyah was taken into custody and placed under house arrest for seven months in the new sultan's palace in [[Alexandria]].<ref name=":2" /> He was freed when Al-Nasir Muhammad retook the position of sultan on 4 March 1310.<ref name=":2" /> Having returned to Cairo a week later, he was received by the sultan Al-Nasir.<ref name=":2" /> The sultan would sometimes consult Ibn Taymiyyah on religious affairs and policies during the rest of his three-year stay in Cairo.<ref name=":9" /><ref name=":2" /> During this time he continued to teach and wrote his famous book Al-''Kitab al-Siyasa al-shar'iyya'' ''(Treatise on the Government of the Religious Law)'', a book noted for its account of the role of religion in politics.<ref name=":2" /><ref>{{cite book|title=Fifty Key Figures in Islam|last=Jackson|first=Roy|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=0-415-35468-4 |pages=130}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=New Political Religions, Or an Analysis of Modern Terrorism|last=Cooper|first=Barry|publisher=University of Missouri Press|year=2005|isbn=0-8262-1621-8 |pages=96–97}}</ref>

== Return to Damascus and later years ==
He spent his last fifteen years in Damascus. Ibn Taymiyyah at the age of 50 returned to Damascus on 28 February 1313 by way of Jerusalem.<ref name=":2" /> Damascus was now under the governorship of [[Tankiz]]. In Damascus Ibn Taymiyyah continued his teaching role as professor of Hanbali fiqh. This is when he taught his most famous student, [[Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya]], who went on to become a noted scholar in Islamic history.<ref name=":2" /> Ibn Qayyim was to share in Ibn Taymiyyah's renewed persecution.

Three years after his arrival in the city, Ibn Taymiyyah became involved in efforts to deal with the increasing Shia influence amongst the Muslims.<ref name=":2" /> An agreement had been made in 1316 between the amir of Mecca and the Ilkhanate ruler [[Öljaitü]], brother of Ghazan Khan, to allow a favourable policy towards Shi'ism in [[Mecca]], a city that houses the holiest site in Islam, the [[Kaaba]].<ref name=":2" /> Around the same time the Shia theologian [[Al-Hilli]], who had played a crucial role in the Mongol rulers decision to make Shi'ism the state religion of Persia,<ref>{{cite book|title=Islam: The Key Concepts |last=Ali |first=Kecia |publisher=Routledge|year=2007|isbn=0-415-39639-5 |pages=125}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Rationalism in the School of Bahrain: A Historical Perspective, in Shīʻite Heritage: Essays on Classical and Modern Traditions |last=Clarke|first=Lynda|publisher=Global Academic Publishing|year=2001 |pages=336}}</ref> wrote the book, [[Minhaj al-karamah|''Minhaj al-Karamah'']]'' (''The Way of Charisma'),<ref name=":9" /> which dealt with the Shia doctrine of the [[Imamate (Twelver doctrine)|Imamate]] and also served as a refutation of the Sunni doctrine of the [[caliphate]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Formation of the Classical Tafsīr Tradition|last=A. Saleh |first=Walid|publisher=Brill Academic Pub|year=2004|isbn=9004127771 |pages=220}}</ref> To counter this Ibn Taymiyyah wrote his famous book, ''[[Minhaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah]]'', as a refutation of Al-Hilli's work.<ref>{{cite book|title=Medieval Islamic Historiography: Remembering Rebellion|last=N.

=== Fatwa on divorce and imprisonment ===
In 1318 Ibn Taymiyyah wrote a treatise that would curtail the ease with which a Muslim man could [[Divorce in Islam|divorce]] his wife. Ibn Taymiyyah's fatwa on divorce was not accepted by the majority of scholars of the time and this continued into the [[Ottoman Caliphate|Ottoman era]].<ref name=":23">{{cite book|title=Ibn Taymiyya and His Times|last=Saleh|first=Walid|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=0-19-547834-7 |chapter=Ibn Tayimiyah and the Rise of Radical Hermeneutics: An Analysis of "An Introduction to the Foundation of Quranic Exegesis}}</ref> However, almost every modern Muslim nation-state has come to adopt Ibn Taymiyyah's position on this issue of divorce.<ref name=":23" /> At the time he issued the fatwa, Ibn Taymiyyah revived an edict by the sultan not to issue fatwas on this issue but he continued to do so, saying, "I cannot conceal my knowledge".<ref name=":2" />{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=12}} As in previous instances, he stated that his fatwa was based on the Qur'an and hadith. His view on the issue was at odds with the Hanbali doctrine.<ref name=":2" /> This proved controversial among the people in Damascus as well as the Islamic scholars and the authorities who were against him on the issue.<ref name=":8">{{cite book|title=The Mamluks in Egyptian and Syrian Politics and Society|last=Winter|first=Michael|publisher=BRILL|year=2004|isbn=9004132864|pages=191–220}}</ref>

According to the scholars of the time, an oath of divorce counted as a full divorce and they were also of the view that three oaths of divorce taken under one occasion counted as three separate divorces.<ref name=":8" /> The significance of this was, that a man who divorces the same partner three times is no longer allowed to remarry that person until and if that person marries and divorces another man.<ref name=":8" /> Only then could the man, who took the oath, remarry his previous wife.<ref name=":8" /> Ibn Taymiyyah accepted this but rejected the validity of three oaths taken under one sitting, to count as three separate divorces as long as the intention was not to divorce.<ref name=":8" /> Moreover, Ibn Taymiyyah was of the view that a single oath of divorce uttered but not intended, also does not count as an actual divorce.<ref name=":2" /> He stated that since this is an oath much like an oath taken in the name of God, a person must expiate for an unintentional oath in a similar manner.<ref name=":8" />

Due to his views and also by not abiding to the sultan's letter two years before forbidding him from issuing a fatwa on the issue, three council hearing were held, in as many years (1318, 1319 and 1320), to deal with this matter.<ref name=":2" /> The hearing were overseen by the Viceroy of Syria, Tankiz.<ref name=":2" /> This resulted in Ibn Taymiyyah being imprisoned on 26 August 1320 in the [[Citadel of Damascus]].<ref name=":2" /> He was released about five months and 8 days later,{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=12}} on 9 February 1321, by order of the Sultan Al-Nasir.<ref name=":2" /> Ibn Taymiyyah was reinstated as teacher of Hanbali law and he resumed teaching.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=12}}

=== Risāla on visiting tombs and final imprisonment ===
Ibn Taymiyyah had written a ''[[Risalah (fiqh)|risāla]]'' (a treatise) in 1310 called ''Ziyārat al-ḳubūr''<ref name=":2" /> or according to another source, ''Shadd al-rihal''.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=12}} It dealt with the validity and permissibility of making a journey to visit the tombs of prophets and [[Wali|saints]] (Wali).{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=12}} It is reported that in the book "he condemned the cult of saints".<ref name=":2" /> He declared that, the one who visits the Prophet's grave commits innovation (bidah).{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} Criticism of the book arose after nearly 16 years of Ibn Taymiyyah writing it. and he was arrested and imprisoned at the age of 63, on 18 July 1326, in the Citadel of Damascus with an order from the sultan also prohibiting him from issuing any further fatwas.<ref name=":2" />{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=12}} The reason for his arrest was his declaration that the one who travels to visit the Prophet's grave commits innovation (''bidah''). His student Ibn Qayyim was also imprisoned with him in the Citadel.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=12}}

=== Life in prison ===
[[File:Damaskus4.jpg|300px|thumb|right|[[Citadel of Damascus]] the last prison where Ibn Taymiyyah died there]]
Ibn Taymiyyah referred to prison as "a divine blessing".<ref name=":9" /> During his incarceration he wrote that, "when a scholar forsakes what he knows of the Book of God and of the sunnah of his messenger and follows the ruling of a ruler which contravenes a ruling of God and his messenger, he is a renegade, an unbeliever who deserves to be punished in this world and in the hereafter."<ref name=":9" />

Whilst in prison he faced opposition from the Maliki and Shafii Chief Justices of Damascus, Taḳī al-Dīn al-Ik̲h̲nāʾī<ref name=":2" /> He remained in prison for over two years and ignored the sultan's prohibition, by continuing to deliver fatwas.<ref name=":2" /> During his incarceration Ibn Taymiyyah wrote three works which are extant; ''Kitāb Maʿārif al-wuṣūl, Rafʿ al-malām'', and ''Kitāb al-Radd ʿala ’l-Ik̲h̲nāʾī'' (The response to al-Ik̲h̲nāʾī).<ref name=":2" /> The last book was an attack on Taḳī al-Dīn al-Ik̲h̲nāʾī, and explained his views, on saints (wali).<ref name=":2" />

== Death ==
Ibn Taymiyyah fell ill in early September 1328 and died at the age of 65, on 26 September of that year, whilst in prison at the Citadel in Damascus.<ref name=":2" /> Once this news reached the public, there was a strong show of support for him from the people.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=14}} After the authorities had given permission, it is reported that thousands of people came to show their respects.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=14}} They gathered in the Citadel and lined the streets up to the Umayyad mosque which was and is still close by.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=14}} A Janaza (funeral prayer) was held in the citadel by the sheikh, Muhammad Tammam, and a second was held in the mosque.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=14}} A third and final funeral prayer was held by Ibn Taymiyyah's brother, the sheikh, Zain al-Din.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=14}} He was buried in Damascus, in ''Maqbara Sufiyya'' (the cemetery of the Sufis).

== Influences ==
{{salafi|Ideology}}

Ibn Taymiyyah was taught by scholars who were renowned in their time.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=7}} However, there is no evidence that any of the contemporary scholars influenced him.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=7}}

A strong influence on Ibn Taymiyyah was the founder of the Hanbali school of Islamic jurisprudence, Ahmad ibn Hanbal.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=7}} Ibn Taymiyyah was trained in this school and he had studied Ibn Hanbal's [[Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal|Musnad]] in great detail, having studied it over multiple times.<ref>{{cite book|title=Fawat al-Wafayat|last=Al-Kutubi|first=Shakir |year=1881 |pages=35}}</ref> Though he spent much of his life following this school, in the end he renounced [[taqlid]] (blind following).{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=8}}

His work was most influenced by the sayings and actions of the [[Salaf]] (first 3 generation of Muslims) and this showed in his work where he would give preference to the Salaf over his contemporaries.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=7}} The modern [[Salafi movement]] derives its name from this school of thought.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=7}}

== Views ==
=== God's Attributes ===
Ibn Taymiyyah said that God should be described as he has described himself in the Qur'an and the way Prophet Muhammad has described God in the Hadith.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":24" /> He rejected; the [[Ta'tili]]'s who denied these attributes, those who compare God with the creation ([[Tashbih]]) and those who engage in [[Esoteric interpretation of the Quran|esoteric interpretations]] (ta'wil) of the Qur'an or use symbolic exegesis.<ref name=":2" /> Ibn Taymiyyah said that those attributes which we know about from the two above mentioned sources, should be ascribed to God.<ref name=":2" /> Anything regarding God's attributes which people have no knowledge of, should be approached in a manner, according to Ibn Taymiyyah, where the mystery of the unknown is left to God (called tafwid) and the Muslim's submit themselves to the word of God and the Prophet (called taslim).<ref name=":2" /> Henri Laoust says that through this framework, this doctrine, "provides authority for the widest possible scope in personal internationalization of religion."<ref name=":2" />

In 1299 Ibn Taymiyyah wrote the book Al-Aqida al-hamawiyya al-kubra, which dealt with, among other topics, theology and creed. When he was accused of anthropomorphism, a private meeting was held between scholars in the house of Al-Din `Umar al-Kazwini who was a Shafii judge.<ref name=":2" /><ref>{{cite book|title=Islamic Theology, Philosophy and Law: Debating Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya|last=Krawietz|first=Birgit|publisher=de Gruyter|year=2012|isbn=3-11-028534-7 |pages=195}}</ref> After careful study of this book, he was cleared of those charges.<ref name=":2" /> Ibn Taymiyyah also wrote another book dealing with the attributes of God called, ''Al-Aqidah Al-Waasitiyyah''. He faced considerable hostility towards these views from the Ash'ari's of whome the most notable were, [[Taqi al-Din al-Subki]] and his son [[Taj al-Din al-Subki]] who were influential Islamic jurists and also chief judge of Damascus in their respective times.<ref name=":2" />

Ibn Taymiyyah's highly intellectual discourse at explaining "The Wise Purpose of God, Human Agency, and the Problems of Evil & Justice" using God's attributes as a means has been illustrated by Dr. Jon Hoover in his work ''Ibn Taymiyyah's Theodicy of Perpetual Optimism''.<ref name="Ibn Taymiyyah's Theodicy of Perpetual Optimism">{{cite book|last=Hoover|first=Jon|title=Ibn Taymiyya's Theodicy of Perpetual Optimism|year=2007|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=9789004158474|pages=xii, 276|url=http://www.brill.nl/ibn-taymiyyas-theodicy-perpetual-optimism|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}</ref>

=== On the Division of Tawhid ===
Ibn Taymiyyah supported the academic division of tawhid into three classifications; Rububiyyah (Allah is the Lord of all existence and disposer of all affairs), Uluhiyyah (singling out the oneness of Allah in worship) and Asmaa wa sifaat (the affirmation of the Names and Attributes of Allah).{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} His works discuss the pagans at the time of revelation as accepting Allah's Rububiyyah but rejecting His Uluhiyyah, whereby they continued to worship idols.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

=== Duration of Hellfire ===
Ibn Taymiyyah held the belief that Hell was not eternal even for unbelievers.<ref name="HooverIT">{{Cite journal|last=Hoover|first=Jon|year=2016|title=Withholding judgment on Islamic universalism: Ibn al-Wazir (d. 840/1436) on the duration and purpose of hell-fire.

Ibn Taymiyyah was partially supported in his view by the [[Zaydi]] [[Shi'ite]] [[Ibn al-Wazir]].<ref name="HooverIT"/>

=== Sources of Shari'a ===
Of the four fundamental sources of the sharia accepted by thirteenth century Sunni jurists—
#[[Qur'an]],
#[[sunnah]],
#[[ijma|consensus of jurists (ijma)]], and
#[[qiyas]] (analogical reasoning),

—Ibn Taymiyyah opposed the use of consensus of jurists, replacing it with the consensus of the "companions" (''[[sahaba]]'').<ref name=":16" /><ref name=kadri-130 />

Like all Islamic jurists Ibn Taymiyyah believed in a hierarchy sources for the Sharia. Most important was the Quran, and the sunnah or any other source could not abrogate a verse of the Qur'an.{{sfn|Haque|1982|pp=66-67}} (For him, [[Naskh (tafsir)|an abrogation of a verse]], known in Arabic as ''Naskh'', was only possible through another verse in the Qur'an.{{sfn|Haque|1982|pp=66-67}}) Next was sunnah which other sources (besides the Quran) must not contradict.

==== Consensus (ijma) ====
Concerning Consensus (''ijma''), he believed that consensus of any Muslims other than that of the companions of Muhammad could not be "realistically verifiable" and so was speculative,<ref name=":16" /> and thus not a legitimate source of Islamic law (except in certain circumstances).<ref name=":16" /> The consensus (ijma) used must be that of the companions found in their reported sayings or actions.{{sfn|Haque|1982|pp=66-67}} According one supporter, Serajul Haque, his rejection of the consensus of other scholars was justified, on the basis of the instructions given to the jurist [[Shuraih Al-Qadhi|Shuraih ibn al-Hârith]] from the Caliph [[Umar]], one of the companions of Muhammad; to make decisions by first referring to the Qur'an, and if that is not possible, then to the sayings of the Prophet and finally to refer to the agreement of the companions like himself.{{sfn|Haque|1982|pp=66–67}}

An example of Ibn Taymiyyah use of his interpretation was in defense of the (temporary) closing of all Christian churches in 1299 in the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] of Egypt. The closing was in violation of a 600-year-old covenant with Christian ''[[dhimmi]]'' known as the [[Pact of Umar]]. But as Ibn Taymiyyah pointed out, while venerable, the pact was written 60 years or so after the time of the companions and so had no legal effect.<ref name=kadri-130>{{cite book|last1=Kadri|first1=Sadakat|title=Heaven on Earth: A Journey Through Shari'a Law from the Deserts of Ancient Arabia … |date=2012 |publisher=macmillan |isbn=978-0-09-952327-7|pages=130–1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ztCRZOhJ10wC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Heaven+on+Earth:+A+Journey+Through+Shari%27a+Law&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAWoVChMIob7syrnZxwIVhg6SCh0fYg3Z#v=onepage&q=Heaven%20on%20Earth%3A%20A%20Journey%20Through%20Shari'a%20Law&f=false|}}</ref>

==== Analogy (qiyas) ====
Ibn Taymiyyah considered the use of analogy (qiyas) based on literal meaning of scripture as a valid source for deriving legal rulings.<ref name=":16" />{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=68}} Analogy is the primary instrument of legal rationalism in Islam.<ref name=":19" /> He acknowledged its use as one of the four fundamental [[principles of Islamic jurisprudence]].{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=67}} Ibn Taymiyyah argued against the certainty of [[syllogistic]] arguments and in favour of [[analogy]] (''[[qiyas]]''). He argues that concepts founded on induction are themselves not certain but only probable, and thus a syllogism based on such concepts is no more certain than an argument based on analogy. He further claimed that induction itself depends on a process of analogy. His model of analogical reasoning was based on that of juridical arguments.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ruth Mas |title=Qiyas: A Study in Islamic Logic |journal=Folia Orientalia |volume=34 |pages=113–128 |year=1998 |url=http://www.colorado.edu/ReligiousStudies/faculty/mas/LOGIC.pdf |issn=0015-5675}}</ref><ref name="Sowa">{{cite book|title=Conceptual Structures for Knowledge Creation and Communication: 11th International Conference on Conceptual Structures|last=De Moor|first=Aldo|publisher=Springer|year=2003|isbn=3-540-40576-3 |pages=16–36}}, pp. 16–36</ref> Work by [[John F. Sowa]] have, for example, have used Ibn Taymiyyah's model of analogy.<ref name="Sowa" /> He attached caveats however to the use of analogy because he considered the use of reason to be secondary to the use of revelation.<ref name=":16" /> Ibn Taymiyyah's view was that analogy should be used under the framework of revelation, as a supporting source.<ref name=":16" />

There were some jurists who thought rulings derived through analogy could contradict a ruling derived from the Qur'an and the authentic hadith.<ref name=":16" /> However, Ibn Taymiyyah disagreed because he thought a contradiction between the definitive canonical texts of Islam, and definitive reason was impossible<ref name=":16" /> and that this was also the understanding of the salaf.<ref name=":20">{{cite book|title=Ibn Taymiyya and His Times, Proceedings of a Conference Held at Princeton University|last=El-Omari|first=Racha|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=0-19-547834-7 |chapter=Ibn Taymiyya's Theology of the Sunna through His Polemics with the Ash‘arites.}}</ref> Racha el-Omari says that on an epistemological level, Ibn Taymiyyah considered the Salaf to be better than any other later scholars in understanding the agreement between revelation and reason.<ref name=":20" /> One example for this is the use of analogy in the Islamic legal principle of [[maslaha]] (public good) about which Ibn Taymiyya believed, if there were to be any contradiction to revelation then it is due to a misunderstanding or misapplication of the concept of utility.<ref name=":19" /><ref name=":28">{{cite book|title=Maṣlaḥah and the Purpose of the Law: Islamic Discourse on Legal Change from the 4th/10th to 8th/14th Century|last=Opwis|first=Felicitas Meta Maria|publisher=Brill|year=2010|isbn=9789004184169 |pages=189}}</ref> He said that to assess the utility of something, the criteria for benefit and harm should come from the Qur'an and sunnah, a criteria which he also applied to the establishment of a correct analogy.<ref name=":19" /><ref name=":28" />

An example of Ibn Taymiyyah's use of analogy was in a fatwa forbidding the use of hashish one the grounds that it was analogous to wine, and users should be given 80 lashes in punishment. "Anyone who disagreed was an apostate, he added, whose corpse ought not to be washed or given a decent burial."<ref name=kadri-130 />

==== Reason (`Aql) ====
Issues surrounding the use of reason ([['Aql]]) and rational came about in relation to the attributes of God for which he faced much resistance.<ref name=":19" /> At the time the Islamic scholars thought the attributes of God as stated in the Qur'an were contradictory to reason so sought other explanations instead.<ref name=":19" /> Ibn Taymiyyah believed that reason itself validated the entire Qur'an as being reliable and in light of that he argued, if some part of the scripture was to be rejected then this would render the use of reason as an unacceptable avenue through which to seek knowledge.<ref name=":19" /> He thought that the most perfect rational method and use of reason was contained within the Qur'an and sunnah and that the theologians of his time had used rational and reason in a flawed manner.<ref name=":19" />

=== Criticism of the Grammarians ===
Ibn Taymiyyah had mastered the grammar of Arabic and one of the books which he studied was the book of Arabic grammar called Al-Kitab, by [[Sibawayh]].{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=20}} In later life he met the Qur'an commentator [[Abu Hayyan al-Gharnati]] to whom he expressed that, "Sibawayh was not the Prophet of [[Syntax]] nor was he infallible. He committed eighty mistakes in his book which are not intelligible to you."{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=20}} Ibn Taymiyyah is thought to have severely criticized Sibawayh but the actual substance of those criticisms is not known because the book that Ibn Taymiyyah wrote, ''al-Bahr'', within which he wrote the criticisms has been lost.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=20}} He stated that when there is an explanation of an [[Ayah]] of the Qur'an or a Hadith, from the Prophet himself, the use of philology or a grammatical explanation becomes obsolete.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=21}} He also said one should refer only to the understanding of the Salaf (first three generations of Muslims) when interpreting a word within the scriptural sources.<ref name=":19" /> However he did not discount the contributions of the grammarians completely.{{sfn|Haque|1982|pp=20–21}} Ibn Taymiyyah stated that the Arabic nouns within the scriptural sources have been divided by the [[faqih|fuqaha]] (Islamic jurists) into three categories; those that are defined by the shari'a, those defined by [[philology]] (lugha) and finally those that are defined by [[urf|social custom (`urf)]].{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=21}} For him each of these categories of nouns had to be used in their own appropriate manner.{{sfn|Haque|1982|pp=21–24}}

=== Madh'hab ===
Ibn Taymiyyah censured the scholars for blindly conforming to the precedence of early jurists without any resort to the Qur'an and Sunnah. He contended that although juridical precedence has its place, blindly giving it authority without contextualization, sensitivity to societal changes, and evaluative mindset in light of the Qur'an and Sunnah can lead to ignorance and stagnancy in [[Sharia|Islamic Law]]. Ibn Taymiyyah likened the extremism of ''[[Taqlid]]'' (blind conformity to juridical precedence or school of thought) to the practice of [[Jews]] and [[Christians]] who took their [[rabbi]]s and [[ecclesiastic]]s as gods besides God. In arguing against taqlid, he said the salaf, who in order to better understand and live according to the commands of God, had to make ijtihad using the scriptural sources.<ref name=":17" /> The same approach, in his view, was needed in modern times.<ref name=":17" />

Ibn Taymiyyah believed that the best role models for Islamic life were the first three generations of Islam ([[Salaf]]); which constitute Muhammad's [[Sahabah|companions]], referred to in Arabic as Sahaba (first generation), followed by the generation of Muslims born after the death of Muhammad known as the [[Tabi‘un|Tabi'un]] (second generation) which is then followed lastly by the next generation after the Tabi'un known as [[Tabi‘ al-Tabi‘in|Tabi' Al-Tabi'in]] (third generation). Ibn Taymiyyah gave precedence to the ideas of the Sahaba and early generations, over the founders of the Islamic schools of jurisprudence.<ref name=":2" /> For Ibn Taymiyyah it was the Qur'an, the sayings and practices of Muhammad and the ideas of the early generations of Muslims that constituted the best understanding of Islam. Any deviation from their practice was viewed as bid‘ah, or innovation, and to be forbidden. He also praised and wrote a commentary on some speeches of [[Abdul-Qadir Gilani]].<ref name="qadiri">{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.se/~m9783/n/itaysf_e.html |title=IBN TAYMIYYA ON FUTOOH AL-GHAYB AND SUFISM|author=G.

=== Islamic law and polity ===
Ibn Taymiyya believed that Islamic policy and management was based on {{cite quran|4|58|s=ns}},<ref name=Alshamsi-54>{{cite book|last1=Alshamsi|first1=Mansoor Jassem|title=Islam and Political Reform in Saudi Arabia: The Quest for Political Change|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|page=54|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-rJ8AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA54&dq=siyasa+ibn+taymiyyah&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAWoVChMI9Yq009qDyAIVh36SCh1fkgLI#v=onepage&q=siyasa%20ibn%20taymiyyah&f=false|accessdate=19 September 2015}}</ref> and that the goal of ''al-siyasa'' (politics, the political) should be to protect ''al-din'' (religion) and to manage ''al-dunya'' (worldly life and affairs). Religion and the State should be inextricably linked, in his view,<ref name=":2" /> as the state was indispensable in providing justice to the people, enforcing Islamic law by [[Enjoining good and forbidding wrong|enjoining good and forbidding evil]], unifying the people and preparing a society conducive to the [[Ibadah|worship of God]].<ref name=":2" /> He believed that "enjoining good and forbidding wrong" was the duty of every state functionary with charge over other Muslims, from the caliph to "the schoolmaster in charge of assessing children's handwriting exercises."<ref>Ibn Taymiyya, ''Le traite de droit public d'ibn Taimiya''. Translated by Henri Laoust. Beirut, 1948, p.12</ref><ref name=kadri-139 />

Ibn Taymiyyah supported giving broad powers to the state. In ''Al-siyasa al-Shar`iyah'', he focused on duties of individuals and punishments rather than rules and procedural limits of authorities.<ref name=kadri-139 /> Suspected highway robbers who would not reveal their accomplices or the location of their loot, for example should be held in detention and lashed for indefinite periods.<ref name=kadri-139>{{cite book|last1=Kadri|first1=Sadakat|title=Heaven on Earth: A Journey Through Shari'a Law from the Deserts of Ancient Arabia ...|date=2012|publisher=macmillan|isbn=978-0-09-952327-7|page=139|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ztCRZOhJ10wC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Heaven+on+Earth:+A+Journey+Through+Shari%27a+Law&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAWoVChMIob7syrnZxwIVhg6SCh0fYg3Z#v=onepage&q=Heaven%20on%20Earth%3A%20A%20Journey%20Through%20Shari'a%20Law&f=false|}}</ref> He also allowed the lashing of imprisoned debtors, and "trials of suspicion"  (''da`sawi al-tuham'') where defendants could be convicted without witnesses or documentary proof.<ref name=kadri-139-40>{{cite book|last1=Kadri|first1=Sadakat|title=Heaven on Earth: A Journey Through Shari'a Law from the Deserts of Ancient Arabia ...|date=2012|publisher=macmillan|isbn=978-0-09-952327-7|pages=139–40|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ztCRZOhJ10wC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Heaven+on+Earth:+A+Journey+Through+Shari%27a+Law&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAWoVChMIob7syrnZxwIVhg6SCh0fYg3Z#v=onepage&q=Heaven%20on%20Earth%3A%20A%20Journey%20Through%20Shari'a%20Law&f=false|}}</ref>

Henri Laoust said that Ibn Taymiyyah never propagated the idea of a single [[caliphate]] but believed the Muslim ummah or community would form into a confederation of states.<ref name=":2" /> Laoust further stated that Ibn Taymiyyah called for obedience only to God, and the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, and he did not put a limit on the number of leaders a Muslim community could have.<ref name=":2" /> However Mona Hassan, in her recent study of the political thoughts of Ibn Taymiyyah, questions this and says laoust has wrongly claimed that Ibn Taymiyyah thought of the caliphate as a redundant idea.<ref name=":21">{{cite book|title=Ibn Taymiyyah and His Times |last=Hassan|first=Mona|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=0-19-547834-7|chapter=Modern Interpretations and Misinterpretations of a Medieval Scholar: Apprehending the Political Thought of Ibn Taymiyyah.}}</ref> Hassan has shown that Ibn Taymiyyah considered the Caliphate that was under the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun Caliphs]]; [[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar]], [[Uthman]], and [[Ali]], as the moral and legal ideal.<ref name=":21" /> The Caliphate in his view could not be ceded "in favour of secular kingship (mulk).<ref name=":21" />

=== Jihad ===
Ibn Taymiyyah was noted for emphasis he put on the importance of [[jihad]] and for the "careful and lengthy attention" he gave "to the questions of martyrdom" in jihad, such as benefits and blessings to be had for martyrs in the afterlife.<ref name="WahhabiIslam" /> He asserted that martyrdom and eternal rewards and blessings, . He wrote that, "It is in jihad that one can live and die in ultimate happiness, both in this world and in the Hereafter. Abandoning it means losing entirely or partially both kinds of happiness."<ref name="Peters-jihad-48">{{cite book |last=Peters |first=Rudolph |title=Jihad in Classical and Modern Islam: A Reader |publisher=Marcus Wiener |year=1996 |location=Princeton |page=48}}</ref>

He defined [[jihad]] as:

<blockquote>"It comprehends all sorts of worship, whether inward or outward, including love for Allah, being sincere to Him, relying on Him, relinquishing one’s soul and property for His sake, being patient and austere, and keeping remembrance of Almighty Allah. It includes what is done by physical power, what is done by the heart, what is done by the tongue through calling to the way of Allah by means of authoritative proofs and providing opinions, and what is done through management, industry, and wealth."<ref>[[Abdallah Bin Bayyah|Bin Bayyah]], [http://binbayyah.net/english/2012/01/18/the-concept-of-jihad/ The Concept of Jihad].</ref></blockquote>

He gave a broad definition of what constituted "aggression" against Muslims and what actions by non-believers made jihad against them permissible. He declared
<blockquote>"It is allowed to fight people for (not observing) unambiguous and generally recognized obligations and prohibitions, until they undertake to perform the explicitly prescribed prayers, to pay [[zakat]], to fast during the month of [[Ramadan]], to make the pilgrimage to Mecca and to avoid what is prohibited, such as marrying women in spite of legal impediments, eating impure things, acting unlawfully against the lives and properties of Muslims and the like. It is obligatory to take the initiative in fighting those people, as soon as the Prophet's summons with the reasons for which they are fought has reached them. But if they first attack the Muslims then fighting them is even more urgent, as we have mentioned when dealing with the fighting against rebellious and aggressive bandits."<ref name="WahhabiIslam">{{cite book |last=DeLong-Bas |first=Natana J. |title=Wahhabi Islam: From Revival and Reform to Global Jihad|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]], USA |year=2004 |location=New York |pages=252–3 |edition=First |isbn=0-19-516991-3}}</ref><ref name="Peters-jihad-52">{{cite book |last=Peters |first=Rudolph |title=Jihad in Classical and Modern Islam: A Reader|publisher=Marcus Wiener |year=1996 |location=Princeton |page=52}}</ref></blockquote>
In the modern context, his rulings have been used by some Islamist groups to declare jihad against various governments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e959|title=Ibn Taymiyyah, Taqi al-Din Ahmad |date=2015-02-14|accessdate=February 14, 2015|website=Oxford Islamic Studies Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|last=Esposito|first=John L.}}</ref>

=== Innovation (Bid`ah) ===
{{Main article|Bid‘ah}}
Even though Ibn Taymiyyah has been called a theologian,<ref name=Hallaq-2011>{{cite web|last1=Hallaq|first1=Wael B.|title=Ibn Taymiyya Against the Greek Logicians|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198240433.001.0001/acprof-9780198240433|website=Oxford Scholarship Online|accessdate=20 September 2015|date=October 2011}}</ref> he claimed to reject ''[[Ilm al-Kalam|`ilm al-kalam]]'', known as Islamic theology,  as well as some aspects of [[Sufism]] and [[Aristotelianism|Peripatetic philosophy]], as an innovation (''[[Bid‘ah]]'').<ref name=":15" /> Despite this, Ibn Taymiyyah's works contained numerous arguments that openly refer to rational arguments ([[kalam]]) for their validity<ref>{{cite book|first=Aaron|last=Spevack|title=The Archetypal Sunni Scholar: Law, Theology, and Mysticism in the Synthesis of Al-Bajuri|pages=143/145|publisher=State University of New York Press|date=2014|ISBN=978-1-4384-5370-5}}</ref> and therefore he must be included amongst the [[kalam|Mutakallimin]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Aaron|last=Spevack|title=The Archetypal Sunni Scholar: Law, Theology, and Mysticism in the Synthesis of Al-Bajuri|pages=143|publisher=State University of New York Press|date=2014|ISBN=978-1-4384-5370-5}}</ref>

Ibn Taymiyyah opposed giving any undue religious honors to mosques (even that of [[Jerusalem]], the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]]), to approach or rival in any way the Islamic sanctity of the two most holy [[mosque]]s within Islam, [[Masjid al-Haram]] (in [[Mecca]]) and [[Al-Masjid al-Nabawi]] (in [[Madina]]).<ref name="ziyaarah">"A Muslim Iconoclast (Ibn Taymiyyeh) on the 'Merits' of Jerusalem and Palestine", by Charles D.

[Includes Arabic text of manuscript of Ibn Taymiyya's short work ''Qa'ida fi Ziyarat Bayt-il-Maqdis'' قاعدة في زيارة بيت المقدس]</ref> As to the practice of making journey for the sole purpose of visiting a mosque, Ibn Taymiyyah has said in his books; Majmu'at al-Rasail al-Kubra, Minhaj al-Sunna and Majmu'at Fatawa, that, "Journey must not be made except to three mosques; Masjid al-Haram, Masjid al-Nabawi and Masjid Al-Aqsa".<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{cite book|title=Majmu'at al-Rasail al-Kubra|last=Ibn Taymiyyah|first=Taqi al-Din |year=1905 |location=Cairo|pages=53–63|volume=2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Minhaj al-Sunna al-Nabawiya|last=Ibn Taymiyyah|first=Taqi al-Din|publisher=|year=1903 |location=Bulaq|pages=132|volume=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Majmu'at Fatawa|last=Ibn Taymiyyah|first=Taqi al-Din|publisher=Cairo|year=1908 |pages=185|volume=2}}</ref> Regarding this Serajul Haque says that, "In the opinion of Ibn Taymiyyah only these three mosques have been accepted by the Prophet as the object of journeys, on account of their excellence over all other mosques and places of prayer.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=84}} Ibn Taymiyyah uses a saying (hadith) of the Islamic prophet Muhammad in [[Sahih al-Bukhari|Bukhari]] and [[Sahih Muslim|Muslim]] to justify his view that it is not permitted to journey exclusively to any mosque than Mecca, Medina, or Jerusalem.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=84}}

The ruler [[Sabuktigin|Sabuktegin]] was praised by Ibn Taymiyyah for censuring groups that he considered heretical. Ibn Taymiyyah stated that Sabuktegin, "commanded that [[bidah|Ahlul Bidah]] be publicly cursed on the [[minbar]]s, and as a result the [[Jahm bin Safwan|Jahmiyyah]], [[Rafida]], Hululiyah, [[Mu'tazilah]], and [[Qadariyah]] were all publicly cursed, along with the [[Asharites]]."{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Existence of saints===
Although it is sometimes supposed that Ibn Taymiyyah rejected the very idea of [[saint]]s, which had become a cardinal [[Sunni]] belief in the medieval period,<ref>Jonathan A.C. Brown, "Faithful Dissenters: Sunni Skepticism about the Miracles of Saints," ''Journal of Sufi Studies'' 1 (2012), p. 123</ref><ref>Christopher Taylor, ''In the Vicinity of the Righteous'' (Leiden: Brill, 1999), pp. 5-6</ref><ref>John Renard, ''Friends of God: Islamic Images of Piety, Commitment, and Servanthood'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008); Idem., ''Tales of God Friends: Islamic Hagiography in Translation'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2009, et passim.</ref> scholarship has shown that this is not true.<ref name="Josef W. Meri 2002 p. 68">Josef W. Meri, ''The Cult of Saints among Muslims and Jews in Medieval Syria'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 68</ref> Indeed, while Ibn Taymiyyah did indeed reject widely-established orthodox ''practices'' associated with the veneration of saints in Islam at his time, like [[ziyara|the visitation to their graves]] and [[tawassul|the seeking of their intercession]], he never rejected the actual existence of saints as such. On the contrary, he explicitly states: "The miracles of saints are absolutely true and correct, by the acceptance of all Muslim scholars. And the Qur'an has pointed to it in different places, and the sayings of the Prophet have mentioned it, and whoever denies the miraculous power of saints are only people who are innovators and their followers."<ref>Ibn Taymiyyah, ''al-Mukhtasar al-Fatawa al-Masriyya'', 1980, p. 603</ref> In this particular respect, he differed little from all his contemporaries; for just as practically all of the era's scholars believed that "the lives of saints and their miracles were incontestable,"<ref name="Josef W. Meri 2002 p. 68"/> so also did Ibn Taymiyyah.<ref name="Josef W. Meri 2002 p. 68"/>

Ibn Taymiyyah's most categorical declaration of accepting the existence of saints and their miracles appears in his famous creed '''Aqīda al-Wāsitīya'', in which he states: "Among the fundamentals of the belief of the People of the Sunna is belief in the miracles of the saints (''karāmāt al-awliyā'') and the supernatural acts which God achieves through them in all varieties of knowledge, illuminations (''mukāshafāt''), power, and impressions as it is handed down about the ancient nations in [[Al-Kahf|the chapter of the Cave]] and in other Quranic chapters and is known of the early men among this Community of Believers among the [[Sahaba|Companions]] and [[Tabiun|Followers]] and the rest of the generations of this Community of Believers. It [the blessing of having saints and saintly miracles] will be with them until the [[Day of Resurrection]]."<ref name="Josef W. Meri 2002 p. 68"/>

Although Ibn Taymiyyah was critical of some of the developments within [[Sufism]], he never rejected the practice outright, and actually enumerated a list of early Sufis whom he considered to be among the greatest Islamic saints.<ref>See Ibn Taymiyyah, ''Majmu'a Fatawa Ibn Taymiyya'' (Cairo: Dar ar-Rahmat, u.d.), Vol. 10, p. 516</ref> In this list, he included [[Bayazid Bastami]], [[Junayd of Baghdad]], [[Abdul-Qadir Gilani]], [[Hasan of Basra]], [[Ibrahim ibn Adham]], [[Maruf Karkhi]], [[Sirri Saqti]], and several other venerable personages who have always been venerated in mainstream Sunni Islam as being among the greatest saints of all.<ref>See Ibn Taymiyyah, ''Majmu'a Fatawa Ibn Taymiyya'' (Cairo: Dar ar-Rahmat, u.d.), Vol. 10, p. 516; for the traditional narratives of these saints, see: John Renard, ''Friends of God: Islamic Images of Piety, Commitment, and Servanthood'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008).</ref> Regarding all these early saints, Ibn Taymiyyah even declares: "These great Sufi people were the leaders of humanity, and they were calling to what is right and forbidding what is wrong."<ref>Ibn Taymiyyah, ''Majmu'a Fatawa Ibn Taymiyya'' (Cairo: Dar ar-Rahmat, u.d.), Vol. 10, p. 516</ref> While Ibn Taymiyyah did indeed reject the veneration of saints who promulgated the [[Ibn Arabi|Akbari]] doctrine of [[wahdat al-wajud]], he never rejected the venerability of saints who belonged to all the other Sufi orders.<ref>See Ibn Taymiyyah, ''Majmu'a Fatawa Ibn Taymiyya'' (Cairo: Dar ar-Rahmat, u.d.), Vol. 10</ref>

===Visitation of the tombs of the Prophets and the saints===
Ibn Taymiyyah considered the visitation of the tombs of Prophets and saints as impermissible,{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=83}} a blameworthy innovation<ref name=":15" />{{sfn|Haque|1982|pp=78–81}} and comparable to worshiping something besides God ([[Shirk (Islam)|Shirk]]).<ref name=":15" />{{sfn|Haque|1982|pp=78–81}} This view was vigorously rejected by mainstream [[Sunni]] scholars both during his life and after his death. The [[Shafi'i]] hadith master [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani]] stated that ''"This is one of the ugliest positions that has been reported of Ibn Taymiyya"''<ref name="IT290">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7JRmPgAACAAJ&dq=Ibn+Taymiyya+and+his+times&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y|title=Ibn Taymiyya and His Times|last=Rapoport|first=Yossef|last2=Ahmed|first2=Shahab|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-547834-1|language=en|page=290}}</ref> and also added that travelling to visit the tomb of the Prophet was ''"one of the best of actions and the noblest of pious deeds with which one draws near to God, and it's legitimacy is a matter of consensus."''<ref name="IT291">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7JRmPgAACAAJ&dq=Ibn+Taymiyya+and+his+times&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y|title=Ibn Taymiyya and His Times|last=Rapoport|first=Yossef|last2=Ahmed|first2=Shahab|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-547834-1|language=en|page=291}}</ref> The [[Hanafi]] hadith scholar [[Ali al-Qari]] stated that, ''"Amongst the Hanbalis, Ibn Taymiyya has gone to an extreme by prohibiting travelling to visit the Prophet – may God bless him and grant him peace"''<ref name="IT292">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7JRmPgAACAAJ&dq=Ibn+Taymiyya+and+his+times&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y|title=Ibn Taymiyya and His Times|last=Rapoport|first=Yossef|last2=Ahmed|first2=Shahab|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-547834-1|language=en|page=292}}</ref> [[Al-Qastallani|Qastallani]] stated that ''"The Shaykh Taqi al-Din Ibn Taymiyya has abominable and odd statements on this issue to the effect that travelling to visit the Prophet is prohibited and is not a pious deed."''<ref name="IT293">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7JRmPgAACAAJ&dq=Ibn+Taymiyya+and+his+times&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y|title=Ibn Taymiyya and His Times|last=Rapoport|first=Yossef|last2=Ahmed|first2=Shahab|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-547834-1|language=en|page=293}}</ref> Other scholars in opposition to Ibn Taymiyyah's views include [[Ghazali]],<ref name="IT291" /> [[Nawawi]],<ref name="IT291" /> [[Muhammad al-Munawi|Munawi]]<ref name="IT291" /> and [[Qadi Ayyad]] who stated that visiting the Prophet was ''"a sunna of the Muslims on which there was consensus, and a good and desirable deed."''<ref name="IT291" />

===Intercession===
Ibn Taymiyyah said that seeking the [[Tawassul|assistance of God through intercession]] is allowed, as long as the other person is still alive.{{sfn|Haque|1982|pp=78–81}} However, he believed that those who ask assistance from the grave of the Prophet or saints, are mushrikin (polytheists), someone who is engaged in [[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]].{{sfn|Haque|1982|pp=78–81}} 
This view was also vigorously rejected by mainstream Sunni scholars. For example, the chief judge of Damascus, [[Taqi al-Din al-Subki]] stated that, ''"It is proper to entreat and ask for the help and intercession of the Prophet ﷺ with God. No one from amongst the [[salaf]] and khalaf denied this, until Ibn Taymiyya came along and disapproved of this, and deviated from the straight path, and invented a position that no scholar has said before, and he became a deterrent example for Muslims"''.<ref name="IT29495">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7JRmPgAACAAJ&dq=Ibn+Taymiyya+and+his+times&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y|title=Ibn Taymiyya and His Times|last=Rapoport|first=Yossef|last2=Ahmed|first2=Shahab|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195478341|language=en|pages=294–295}}</ref> Similarly, [[Ibn Hajar al-Haytami|Ibn Hajar]] rejected Ibn Taymiyya's view on intercession and held that he had broken with the established consensus of Sunni scholars,<ref name="IT292"/> as did many other scholars such as [[Muhammad al-Zurqani|Zurqani]] and [[Khalil ibn Ishaq al-Jundi|Khalil ibn Ishaq]].<ref name="IT294">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7JRmPgAACAAJ&dq=Ibn+Taymiyya+and+his+times&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y|title=Ibn Taymiyya and His Times|last=Rapoport|first=Yossef|last2=Ahmed|first2=Shahab|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195478341|language=en|page=294}}</ref>

=== Mutakallimun ===
{{Expand section|1=Ibn Taymiyya and his times with ISBN of 9780195478341|date=February 2015}}
The mutakallimun are scholars who engage in [[ilm al-Kalam]] (rationalst theology) and they were criticised by Ibn Taymiyyah for their use of rationalist theology and philosophy.<ref name=":26" /> He said that the method of kalam was used by the [[Mu`tazila|Mu`tazilites]], [[Jahmi]]tes and [[Ash'ari|Ash`ari's]].<ref name=":26" /> Ibn Taymiyyah considered the use of philosophical proofs and kalam to be redundant because he saw the Qur'an and the Sunna as superior rational proofs.<ref name=":26" /> Ibn Taymiyyah said that these explanations were not grounded in scriptural evidence such as the philosophical explanation of the divine attributes of God or the proof of God using the [[cosmological argument]].<ref name=":26" /> He said that the call to Islam was not made using such methods by the Qur'an or the Prophet and that these theories have only caused errors and corruption.<ref name=":26" /> The mutakallimun called their use of rationalst theology usul al-din (principles of religion) but Ibn Taymiyyah said that the use of rationalist theology has nothing to do with the true usul al-din which comes from God and to state otherwise is to say that the Prophet neglected an important aspect of Islam.<ref name=":26" /> Ibn Taymiyyah says that the usul al-din of the mutakallimun, deserve to be named usul din al-shaytan (principles of Satanic religion).<ref name=":26" />

Ibn Taymiyyah's attempts to focus attention onto Qur'anic rationality was taken up by his student Ibn Qayyim, to the exception of his other followers.<ref name=":26" /> This focus on traditionlist rationlism was also taken up by [[Musa Bigiev]].<ref name=":26" />

=== Sufism ===
Ibn Taymiyyah belonged to the [[Qadiriyya]] [[tariqa]] (order) of [[Sufism]]<ref name="Makdisi, 1973 pp 118-28"/><ref name="Arch91"/><ref name="Rapoport 334"/><ref name="Halverson 2010 48–49"/> and claimed to inherit the [[khirqa]] (spiritual mantle) of the founder of the Qadiriyya order [[Abdul-Qadir Gilani|'Abd al-Qadir al-Jilani]].<ref name="Arch91"/>
Among his explicit positive references to Sufism and the [[Qadiriyya]] [[tariqa]] in particular, Ibn Taymiyyah referred to Jilani as "Shaykhuna" (our Shaykh) and "Sayyidi" (my master).<ref name="Arch92"/> He spoke highly of a great many other Sufi Shaykhs also such as [[Abu Yazid al-Bistami]] and [[al-Junayd]].<ref name="Arch92">{{cite book|last=Spevack|first=Aaron|title=The Archetypal Sunni Scholar: Law, Theology, and Mysticism in the Synthesis of Al-Bajuri|publisher=State University of New York Press|date=2014|isbn=143845371X|page=92}}</ref> and went to great lengths to state that Sufism is not a heretical innovation ([[bid'ah]]).<ref name="Arch92"/>

Despite this, Ibn Taymiyyah rejected two views associated with some Sufis. Firstly, he rejected [[monism#Sufism|monism]] which he believed was similar to the [[pantheism|pantheistic]] belief that God "encompasses all things".{{sfn|Reynolds|2012|p=174}} This rejection included denouncing the views of [[Ibn Arabi]].<ref name=":2" /> Secondly he said that the view that [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|spiritual enlightenment]] is of a greater importance than obeying the [[sharia]] was a failure to properly follow the example of Muhammad (s).{{sfn|Reynolds|2012|p=174}} On Ibn Arabi, and Sufism in general, Henri Laoust says that Ibn Taymiyyah never condemned Sufism in itself, but only that which he considered to be, inadmissible deviations in doctrine, ritual or morals, such as [[monism]], [[antinomianism]] or [[esotericism]].<ref name=":2" />

=== Shi'a Islam ===
{{Main article|Minhaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah}}
{{Expand section|1=Ibn Taymiyya and his times with ISBN of 9780195478341|date=February 2015}}
Ibn Taymiyyah was extremely critical of Shia and considered them religiously bankrupt, among the most morally depraved people and the root cause of many Islamic ills.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Memon|editor1-first=Muhammad Umar|editor1-link=Muhammad Umar Memon|title=Ibn Taimiya's Struggle Against Popular Religion: With an Annotated Translation of His Kitab iqtida as-sirat al-mustaqim mukhalafat ashab al-jahim|date=1976|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=9783111662381|page=361|edition=reprint}}</ref> His severe critique of Twelver Shia in his book, ''Minhaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah, ''was written in response to the book ''[[Minhaj al-karamah|Minhaj al-karama fi ma'rifat al-imama]]'', by the Shia theologian [[Al-Hilli]].<ref name=":22">{{cite book|title=Ibn Taymiyyah and His Times|last=al-Jamil|first=Tariq|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=0-19-547834-7 |chapter=Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn al-Mutahhar al-Hilli: Shi`a Polemics and the Struggle for Religious Authority in Medieval Islam}}</ref> He focused his criticisms to the similarity between Shia, Christians and Jews.<ref name=":22" />

Regarding the Shia mourning for Husayn on [[Day of Ashura|Ashura]], Ibn Taymiyyah considered Husayn's martyrdom as a divinely bestowed honour—not a major tragedy. He also argued that such mourning was never instructed by Muhammad and that the Islamic response to recent (let alone ancient) loss is not extravagant mourning but to endure the loss with patience and trust in God. However, he also believed those who celebrated on Ashura were anti-Shia zealots ("''[[Nasibi|al-nawasib]]''") or ignorant people.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Marion Holmes Katz|title=The Birth of The Prophet Muhammad: Devotional Piety in Sunni Islam|date=2007|publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=978-1-135-98394-9|page=116}}</ref>

=== Christianity ===

{{Expand section|1=Ibn Taymiyya and his times with ISBN of 9780195478341|date=February 2015}}
He wrote [[polemic]]s against Christians.{{sfn|Reynolds|2012|p=174}}

=== Non-Muslims ===
[[File:DiezAlbumsStudyingTheKoran.jpg|thumb|225px|Ibn Taymiyyah witnessed conversions to [[Islam]] as a growing trend among many [[Mongol]]s.]]Ibn Taymiyyah strongly opposed borrowing from [[Christianity]] or other non-Muslim religions. In his text ''On the Necessity of the Straight Path'' (''kitab iqtida al-sirat al-mustaqim'') he preached that the beginning of Muslim life was the point at which "a perfect dissimilarity with the non-Muslims has been achieved." To this end he opposed the celebration of the [[Mawlid|observance of the birthday]] of the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] Muhammad or the construction of [[mosque]]s around the tombs of Muslim saints saying: "Many of them (the Muslims) do not even know of the Christian origins of these practices."<ref>Muhammad `Umar Memon, ''Ibn Taymiyya's Struggle against Popular Religion, with an annotated translation of Kitab Iqitada'', the Hague, (1976)  p.78, 210</ref>

=== Economic views ===
He elaborated a circumstantial analysis of [[market economies|market mechanism]], with a theoretical insight unusual in his time. Regarding the power of [[supply and demand]], Ibn Taymiyyah said, "If desire for goods increases while its availability decreases, its price rises. On the other hand, if availability of the good increases and the desire for it decreases, the price comes down."<ref>{{cite book |title=A Companion to the History of Economic Thought |chapter=Contributions of Medieval Muslim Scholars to the History of Economics and their Impact: A Refutation of the Schumpeterian Great Gap |last=Hosseini |first=Hamid S. |editor=Biddle, Jeff E. |editor2=Davis, Jon B. |editor3=Samuels, Warren J. |year=2003 |publisher=Blackwell |location=Malden, MA |isbn=0-631-22573-0 |doi=10.1002/9780470999059.ch3 |pages=28}}</ref> His discourses on the welfare advantages and disadvantages of market regulation and deregulation, have an almost contemporary ring to them.<ref>{{cite book|last=Baeck|first=Louis|title=The Mediterranean tradition in economic thought|year=1994|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-09301-5|page=99}}</ref>

However, he also advocated a policy of "fair prices" and "fair profits", with the implication that anything higher would be impious. Such forms of price fixing was detrimental to entrepreneurship.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cizakca|first=Murat|title=Islamic Capitalism and Finance: Origins, Evolution and the Future|year=2013|publisher=Edward Elgar Pub|isbn=978-0857937629|page=xxii}}</ref>

===Eternity of Species===
He argued that there was an alternate view to the view held by philosophers, like [[Ibn Sina]], who claimed the universe was eternal in its entirety, and Islamic scholars, like [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]], who claimed that the universe was created from nothing by God.<ref name="auto">{{cite web | url = http://jis.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/3/287.full.pdf | title=PERPETUAL CREATIVITY IN THE PERFECTION OF GOD: IBN TAYMIYYA’S HADITH COMMENTARY ON GOD’S CREATION OF THIS WORLD | accessdate = 2016-07-20 }}</ref> In his Sharh Hadith Imran ibn Hasan, Ibn Taymiyya distinguishes between species and elements, asserting that the former are eternal with God.<ref name="auto"/><ref>{{cite web | title = DigiTool - Results - Full | url = http://digitool.library.mcgill.ca/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&object_id=36863&local_base=GEN01-MCG02 | accessdate = 2016-07-20 }}</ref> He states: "If it is supposed that the species [of things done] has been with Him from eternity, neither revelation nor reason denies this ‘withness’ (ma^iyya). On the contrary, it is part of His perfection."<ref name="auto"/> In fact, Ibn Taymiyya draws this assertion from his belief that God perpetually creates, i.e. in preeternity.<ref name="auto"/>  John Hoover, in his Perpetual Creativity In The Perfection Of God: Ibn Taymiyya’s Hadith Commentary On God’s Creation Of This World, elaborates, "Following in the footsteps of [[Ibn Sina]] and [[Ibn Rushd]], Ibn Taymiyya then roots God’s perpetual creativity in a Neoplatonic concept of God’s perfection. Power and creativity are necessary concomitants of God’s perfection. If God’s creativity were not perpetual, God would have been devoid of His creativity, as well as other attributes of perfection, in pre-eternity."<ref name="auto"/>

== Assessment ==
=== Salafism ===
Ibn Taymiyyah is thought by some to be the main influence behind the emergence of Salafism. He placed an emphasis on understanding Islam as it was understood by the salaf (first three generations of Muslims).<ref name=":19" />

=== Modern Islamism ===
Various concepts within modern [[Islamism]] can be attributed to Ibn Taymiyyah.<ref name=":9" /> His influence is noted by Yahya Michot who says Ibn Taymiyyah "has thus become a sort of forefather of [[al-Qaeda]]."<ref name=":9" /> One reason for this was his [[Divisions of the world in Islam|categorising the world]] into distinct territories: the domain of Islam (dar al-Islam), where the rule is of Islam and sharia law is enforced; the domain of unbelief (dar-al-kufr) ruled by [[Kafir|unbelievers]]; and the domain of war (dar al-harb) which is territory under the rule of unbelievers who are involved in an active or potential conflict with the domain of Islam.<ref name=":9" /><ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedic Dictionary of Religion (A-F)|last=Chopra|first=Ramesh|publisher=Isha Books |year=2005 |isbn=8182052858 |pages=211–212|volume=1}}</ref> (Ibn Taymiyyah included a fourth. When the Mongols, whom he considered unbelievers, took control of the city of [[Mardin]]<ref name=":10" /> the population included many Muslims. Believing Mardin was neither the domain of Islam, as Islam was not legally applied with an armed forces consisting of Muslims, nor the domain of war because the inhabitants were Muslim,<ref name=":10" /> Ibn Taymiyyah created a new "composite" category, known as ''dar al-`ahd''.<ref name=":9" /><ref name=":12">{{cite book|title=The Shari'a and Islamic Criminal Justice in Time of War and Peace|last=Bassiouni|first=M. Cherif|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2013|isbn=1-107-68417-X|location=|pages=200}}</ref>)

A second concept is making a declaration of apostasy ([[takfir]]) against a Muslim who does not obey Islam.<ref name=":9" /> But at the same time Ibn Taymiyyah maintained that no one can question anothers faith and curse them as based on one's own desire, because faith is defined by God and the Prophet.<ref name=":9" /> He said, rather than cursing or condemning them, an approach should be taken where they are educated about the religion.<ref name=":9" /> A further concept attributed to Ibn Taymiyyah is, "the duty to oppose and kill Muslim rulers who do not implement the revealed law (shari'a).<ref name=":9" />

Ibn Taymiyyah's role in the Islamist movements of the twentieth and twenty first century have also been noted by, the previous Coordinator for Counterterrorism at the United States Department of State, [[Daniel Benjamin]] who labels the chapter on the history of modern Islamic movements in his book ''The Age of Sacred Terror'', as "Ibn Taymiyya and His children".<ref name=":19" /><ref>{{cite book|title=The Age of Sacred Terror: Radical Islam's War Against America|last=Benjamin|first=Daniel|publisher=Random House Trade|year=2003|isbn=0-8129-6984-7 |pages=VI|last2=Simon|first2=Steven}}</ref> Yossef Rapoport, a reader in Islamic history at Queen Mary, however, says this is not a probable narrative.<ref name=":19" />

=== Mardin fatwa and the Mardin Conference ===
One of Ibn Taymiyyah's most famous fatwas is regarding the Mongols who had conquered and destroyed the [[Abbasid caliphate]] in 1258 and had, then converted to Islam.<ref name=":12" /> Once they were in control of Mardin, they behaved unjustly with their subjects so the people of Mardin asked Ibn Taymiyyah for a legal verdict regarding the classification of the territory under which they live.<ref name=":12" /> He categorized the territory as ''dar al-`ahd'' which in some ways is similar to dar al-kufr (domain of unbelievers).<ref name=":12" /> Included in his verdict was declaring the Mongol ruler Ghazan and other Mongols who did not accept shari'a in full, as unbelievers.<ref name=":11">{{cite book|title=World of Faith and Freedom: Why International Religious Liberty Is Vital to American National Security|last=Farr|first=Thomas F.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=0-19-517995-1|pages=227}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of Political Ideologies|last=Freeden|first=Michael|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=0-19-958597-0 |pages=633}}</ref> According to Nettler and Kéchichian, Ibn Taymiyyah affirmed that Jihad against the Mongols, "was not only permissible but obligatory because the latter ruled not according to Sharīʿah but through their traditional, and therefore manmade, [[Yassa]] code. This essentially meant that Mongols were living in a state of ''[[Jahiliyyah|jāhilīyah]] ''(ignorance)."<ref name=":17" /> The authors further state that his two famous student, Ibn Qayyim and Ibn Kathir, agreed with this ruling.<ref name=":17" /> He called for a defensive jihad to mobilise the people to kill the Mongol rulers and any one who supported them, Muslim or non-Muslim.<ref name=":9" /><ref name=":11" /> Ibn Taymiyyah when talking about those who support the Mongols said, "Everyone who is with them (Mongols) in the state over which they rule has to be regarded as belonging to the most evil class of men. He is either an atheist ([[zindīq]]) or a hypocrite who does not believe in the essence of the religion of Islam. This means that he (only) outwardly pretends to be Muslim or he belongs to the worst class of all people who are the people of the bida` (heretical innovations)."<ref>{{cite book|title=In Their Own Words|last=Aaron|first=David|publisher=RAND Corporation|year=2008|isbn=0-8330-4402-8 |pages=46}}</ref>  Yahya Mochet says that, Ibn Taymiyyah's call to war was not simply to cause a "rebellion against the political power in place" but to repel an "external enemy".<ref name=":9" />

In 2010 a group of [[Islamic Scholars]] at the Mardin conference argued that Ibn Taymiyyah's famous fatwa about the residents of Mardin when it was under the control of the Mongols was misprinted into an order to "fight" the people living under their territory, whereas the actual statement is, "The Muslims living therein should be treated according to their rights as Muslims, while the non-Muslims living there outside of the authority of Islamic Law should be treated according to their rights."<ref name=":10">{{cite web|last=al-Turayri,|first=Shaykh Abd al-Wahhab|title=The Mardin Conference – Understanding Ibn Taymiyyah’s Fatwa|url=http://muslimmatters.org/2010/06/29/the-mardin-conference-%E2%80%93-a-detailed-account/|publisher=MuslimMatters|accessdate=29 May 2011}}</ref> They have based their understanding on the original manuscript in the [[Al-Zahiriyah Library]], and the transmission by Ibn Taymiyyah's student [[Ibn Muflih]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/thenationalconversation/comment/a-religious-basis-for-violence-misreads-original-principles |title=A religious basis for violence misreads original principles |work=The National |accessdate=2012-10-04}}</ref> The particapents of the Mardin conference also rejected the categorization of the world into different domains of war and peace, stating that the division was a result of the circumstances at the time.<ref name=":12" /> The participants further stated that the division has become irrelevant with the existence of nation states.<ref name=":12" />

==Reevaluation==
However, some recent scholarship has argued that attempts by [[Salafis]] and [[Salafi jihadism|Jihadis]] to portray the figure of Ibn Taymiyyah as being a direct classical precursor of their own beliefs are flawed inasmuch as they are often borne, according to these same scholars, of a limited reading of the theologian's substantial corpus of works,<ref name="dx.doi.org"/> many of which have not yet been translated from the original Arabic. James Pavlin, for example, has argued: "Ibn Taymiyya remains one of the most controversial Islamic thinkers today because of his supposed influence on many fundamentalist movements. The common understanding of his ideas have been filtered through the bits and pieces of his statements that have been misappropriated by ... [his] alleged supporters."<ref>Ibn Taymiyyah, ''Epistle on Worship: Risalat al-'Ubudiyya'', tr. James Pavlin (London: Islamic Text Society, 2015), intro.</ref> Additionally, Abdul Haq Ansari has argued that the ubiquitous notion that Ibn Taymiyyah rejected [[Sufism]] outright is erroneous, for while "the popular image of Ibn Taymiyyah [is] ... that he [criticized] Sufism indiscriminately ... [was] deadly against the Sufis, and ... [saw] no place for Sufism in Islam,"<ref name="M. Abdul Haq-Ansari 1985 pp. 1-12">M. Abdul Haq-Ansari, "Ibn Taymiyyah and Sufism," ''Islamic Studies'', Vol. 24, No. 1 (Spring, 1985), pp. 1-12</ref> it is historically known, according to the same scholar, that Ibn Taymiyyah actually considered Sufism an essential part of Islam, being on the whole "sympathetic"<ref name="M. Abdul Haq-Ansari 1985 pp. 1-12"/> towards what everyone at the time considered an integral part of Islamic life. Indeed, "far from saying [Sufism] has no place in Islam,"<ref name="M. Abdul Haq-Ansari 1985 pp. 1-12"/> Ibn Taymiyyah, according to the same author, seems to have wanted to reform the practice of medieval Sufism as part of his wider aim to reform Sunni Islam (of which Sufism was a fundamental component at the time) by divesting both these traditions of what he perceived to be [[bidah|heretical innovations]] within them.<ref name="dx.doi.org"/> Moreover, these scholars also point out that Ibn Taymiyyah had a deep reverence and appreciation for the works of such major Sufi saints as [[Junayd]], [[Sahl al-Tustari]], [[Abu Talib al-Makki]], and even [[Bayazid Bastami]],<ref name="dx.doi.org"/> and was part of the [[Qadiriyya]] Sufi order himself.<ref name="Makdisi, 1973 pp 118-28"/><ref name="Arch91"/><ref name="Rapoport 334"/><ref name="Halverson 2010 48–49"/>

== Works ==
Ibn Taymiyyah left a considerable body of work, ranging from 350 according to his student [[Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/introduction/wasiti/taimiyah_3.html#HEADING3 |title=Ibn Taimiyah |publisher=Usc.edu |accessdate=2010-06-09}}</ref> to 500 according to his student [[al-Dhahabi]].<ref name=":17" /><ref>M.M. Sharif, ''A History of Muslim Philosophy'', Pakistan Philosophical Congress, p. 798</ref> [[Oliver Leaman]] says that Ibn Taymiyyah produced some 700 works in the field of Islamic sciences.<ref name=":24" /> His scholarly output has been described as immense with a wide scope and its contents "bear the marks of brilliant insights hastility jotted down".<ref name=":19" /> It is the case however, that his works are not yet fully understood but efforts are being made, at least in the western languages to gain an adequate understanding of his writings.<ref name=":19" /> In his early life, his work was mostly based on theology and the use of reason in interpretation of scriptural evidences, with later works focusing on; refutation of Greek [[logic]], questioning the prevalent practices of the time, and anti-Christian and anti-Shi'i polemics.<ref name=":19" /> Ibn Taymiyyah's total works have not all survived and his extant works of thirty five volumes, are incomplete.<ref name=":19" /> Extant books and essays written by ibn Taymiyyah include:
