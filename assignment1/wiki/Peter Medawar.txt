Medawar was the younger son of a [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] father and a British mother, and was a [[naturalised British citizen]]. He studied at [[Marlborough College]] and [[Magdalen College, Oxford]] and was professor of zoology at the [[University of Birmingham]] and [[University College London]]. Until he was partially disabled by a [[cerebral infarction]], he was Director of the [[National Institute for Medical Research]] at [[Mill Hill]]. With his doctoral student [[Leslie Brent]] and [[postdoc|postdoctoral fellow]] [[Rupert E. Billingham]], he demonstrated the principle of acquired immunological tolerance (the phenomenon of unresponsiveness of the immune system to certain molecules), which was theoretically predicted by Sir [[Frank Macfarlane Burnet]]. This became the foundation of tissue and organ transplantation.<ref name=simpson15>{{cite journal |last=Simpson |first=E. |date=2015 |title=Medawar's legacy to cellular immunology and clinical transplantation: a commentary on Billingham, Brent and Medawar (1956) 'Quantitative studies on tissue transplantation immunity.

== Education and early life ==
Medawar was born on 28 February 1915, in [[Petrópolis]] (a town 40 miles north of [[Rio de Janeiro]]) in [[Brazil]] where his parents were living. He was the second child of [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] Nicholas Agnatius Medawar, born in the village of [[Jounieh]], north of [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]] and British mother Edith Muriel (née Dowling).<ref name=new>{{cite web|title=Sir Peter Medawar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kd_RDty8ft0C&pg=PA14&lpg=PA14&dq=peter+medawar+maronite&source=bl&ots=aedZf67lH7&sig=wZFcIDoQfN5QEeYrGRa8SSyu-0I&hl=iw&sa=X&ei=vCY3T63zN4HXtAb5y5XbDA&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=peter%20medawar%20maronite&f=false|work=[[New Scientist]]|accessdate=27 February 2014|date=12 April 1984}}</ref><ref name="Medawar, Peter Brian">{{cite book | title=[[Van Nostrand's Scientific Encyclopedia]] | publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] | author=Manuel, Diana E. | year=2002 | DOI=10.1002/9780471743989.vse10031 | chapter=Medawar, Peter Brian (1915–1987) | chapterurl=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780471743989.vse10031/abstract}}</ref> His father, a [[Christian Maronite]], became a naturalised British citizen and worked for a British dental supplies manufacturer that sent him to Brazil as an agent.<ref name="Medawar, Peter Brian"/> (He later described his father's profession as selling "false teeth in South America".<ref name=paida>{{cite journal|last1=Paidagogos|title=Just a Human Being|journal=[[The Expository Times]]|date=1986|volume=97|issue=11|pages=352–352|doi=10.1177/001452468609701133}}</ref>), His status as a British citizen was acquired at birth, as he said: "My birth was registered at the British [[Consulate]] in good time to acquire the status of 'natural-born British subject'." Medawar left Brazil with his family for England "towards the end of the war", and he lived there for the rest of his life.<ref name=PBM>Medawar P. B. 1986.

In 1928, Medawar went to [[Marlborough College]] in [[Marlborough, Wiltshire]]<ref name="Medawar, Peter Brian"/> He hated the college because "they were critical and querulous at the same time, wondering what kind of person a Lebanese was—something foreign you can be sure"<ref name="NewSci profile">{{cite journal | url=http://www.robert-temple.com/articles/NewScientist_PMedawar.pdf <!--or https://books.google.com/books?id=Kd_RDty8ft0C&pg=PA14&lpg=PA14#v=onepage&q&f=false --> | title=Sir Peter Medawar | author=[[Robert K.

He was impressed and later influenced by his zoology teacher [[John Z. Young]] who was also taught and inspired by one of his Marlborough teachers, who was barely literate but "a very, very good biology teacher".<ref name="NewSci profile"/>

== Career and research ==
Medawar was appointed Christopher Welch scholar and senior [[Demyship|demy]] of Magdalen in 1935. He also worked at the [[Sir William Dunn School of Pathology]] under Sir Howard Florey (later Nobel laureate, and who inspired him to take up immunology). He became a Rolleston Prizeman in 1942, senior research fellow of [[St John's College, Oxford]] in 1944, and a university demonstrator in zoology and comparative anatomy, also in 1944.<ref name=encyclo>{{cite web|title=Medawar, Peter Brian|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Peter_Brian_Medawar.aspx|website=encyclopedia.com|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|accessdate=19 October 2015}}</ref> He was elected [[Fellow]] of Magdalen by special election during 1938 to 1944 and 1946 to 1947. He did not complete his PhD, as he was unable to spare a completion fee, which he needed more urgently for his appendectomy.<ref name=paida/> Instead Oxford awarded him a DSc in 1947.<ref name=mitchison2009>{{cite web|last=Mitchison|first=Avrion|title=Medawar, Sir Peter Brian (1915–1987)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/40016|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=27 February 2014|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/40016|date=2009|origyear=2004}}</ref>

Medawar was Mason professor of zoology at the [[University of Birmingham]] between 1947 and 1951. He became Jodrell professor of zoology and comparative anatomy at [[University College London]] in 1951. In 1962 he was appointed director of the [[National Institute for Medical Research]]. His predecessor Sir Charles Harrington was an able administrator such that taking over his post was, as he described, "[N]o more strenuous than ... sliding over into the driving-seat of a Rolls-Royce".<ref name=brentnimr>{{cite web|last1=Brent|first1=Leslie|title=Sir Peter Medawar’s years as director of NIMR: a vignette|url=http://www.historyofnimr.org.uk/mill-hill-essays/essays-yearly-volumes/2009-2/sir-peter-medawars-years-as-director-of-nimr-a-vignette/|website=NIMR History|publisher=National Institute for Medical Research|accessdate=19 October 2015}}</ref> He was head of the transplantation section of the [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]]'s clinical research centre, Harrow, from 1971 to 1986. He became professor of experimental medicine at the [[Royal Institution]] (1977–1983), and president of the [[Royal Postgraduate Medical School]] (1981–1987).<ref name=mitchison2009/>

=== Early research ===

Medawar's first scientific research was on the effect of [[malt]] on the development of connective tissue cells ([[mesenchyme]]) in chicken. Reading the draft of the manuscript, Howard Florey commented it as more philosophical than scientific.<ref name=encyclo/> It was published in the ''Quarterly Journal of Experimental Physiology'' in 1937.<ref>{{cite web|title=Peter Medawar papers: Reprints, 1937–1950|url=http://wellcomelibrary.org/player/b17220117|website=Wellcome Library|publisher=Wellcome Trust|accessdate=19 October 2015}}</ref>

Medawar's involvement with what became [[Organ transplant|transplant]] research began during WWII, when he investigated possible improvements in [[Skin grafting|skin grafts]]. His first publication on the subject was "Sheets of Pure Epidermal Epithelium from Human Skin", which was published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 1941.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Medawar|first1=P. B.|title=Sheets of Pure Epidermal Epithelium from Human Skin|journal=Nature|date=1941|volume=148|issue=3765|pages=783–783|doi=10.1038/148783a0}}</ref> His studies particularly concerned solution for skin wounds among soldiers in the war.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Medawar|first1=P.

His research became more focused in 1949, when Burnet, at the [[Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research]] in Melbourne, advanced the hypothesis that during [[embryo]]nic life and immediately after birth, [[Cell (biology)|cells]] gradually acquire the ability to distinguish between their own [[Biological tissue|tissue]] substances on the one hand and unwanted cells and foreign material on the other.<ref name=simpson15/>

With Billingham, he published a seminal paper in 1951.<ref name=Billingham1951>{{Cite journal | last1 = Billingham | first1 = R. E. | last2 = Medawar | first2 = P.

Meaning that the mouse had tolerated the foreign tissue, which would normally be rejected. Their experimental proof of Burnet's hypothesis was first published in a brief article in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 1953,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Billingham|first1=R.

=== Theory of senescence ===
Medawar's 1951 lecture ''An unsolved problem of biology'' (published 1952<ref>Medawar, P. B. (1952). 'An unsolved problem of biology'  HK Lewis and Co.</ref>) addressed ageing and senescence, and he begins by defining both terms as follows:
{{quote|We obviously need a word for mere ageing, and I propose to use 'ageing' itself for just that purpose. 'Ageing' hereafter stands for mere ageing, and has no other innuendo. I shall use the word 'senescence' to mean ageing accompanied by that decline of bodily faculties and sensibilities and energies which ageing colloquially entails.}}

He then tackles the question of why evolution has permitted organisms to senesce, even though (1) senescence lowers individual fitness, and (2) there is no obvious necessity for senescence. In answering this question, Medawar provides two fundamental and interrelated insights. First, there is an inexorable decline in probability of an organism's existence, and, therefore, in what he terms "reproductive value." He suggests that it therefore follows that the force of [[natural selection]] weakens progressively with age late in life (because the [[fecundity]] of younger age-groups is overwhelmingly more significant in producing the next generation). What happens to an organism after reproduction is only weakly reflected in natural selection by the effect on its younger relatives. He pointed out that likelihood of death at various times of life, as judged by [[life tables]], was an indirect measure of [[fitness (biology)|fitness]], that is, the capacity of an organism to propagate its genes. Life tables for humans show, for example that the lowest likelihood of death in human females comes at about age 14, which in primitive societies would likely be an age of peak reproduction. This has served as the basis for all three modern theories for the [[evolution of ageing|evolution of senescence]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ljubuncic|first=Predrag|last2=Reznick|first2= Abraham Z.|title=The Evolutionary Theories of Aging Revisited &ndash; A Mini-Review|journal=Gerontology|year=2009|volume=55|issue=2|pages=205–216|doi=10.1159/000200772|pmid=19202326}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Charlesworth|first=Brian|authorlink=Brian Charlesworth|title=Fisher, Medawar, Hamilton and the evolution of aging.|journal=Genetics|year=2000|volume=156|issue=3|pages=927–31|pmid=11063673| pmc=1461325 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Promislow|first=Daniel E.

=== Books  by Medawar===
Medawar was recognised as a brilliant author: [[Richard Dawkins]] called him "the wittiest of all scientific writers"<ref name=richard/> and ''[[New Scientist]]'' magazine's obituary called him "perhaps the best science writer of his generation".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Editorial |title=Peter Medawar (obituary) |journal=New Scientist |volume=116 |issue=1581 |pages=16 |date=October 1987}}</ref> He was also awarded the 1987 [[Michael Faraday Prize]] "''for the contribution his books had made in presenting to the public, and to scientists themselves, the intellectual nature and the essential humanity of pursuing science at the highest level and the part it played in our modern culture''".

One of his best-known essays is his 1961 criticism of [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]]'s ''[[The Phenomenon of Man]]'', of which he said: "Its author can be excused of dishonesty only on the grounds that before deceiving others he has taken great pains to deceive himself".<ref name=Medawar1996>{{cite book |year=1996 |last=Medawar|first= Peter |chapter=The Phenomenon of Man |page=1 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=C8-PkAfzShoC&pg=PA1&dq=phenomenon+of+man+medawar&hl=en&ei=yo6dTJ-WM4ffceGbhdsJ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=phenomenon%20of%20man%20medawar&f=false |editor=.|title=The Strange Case of the Spotted Mice: And other classic essays on science |url=https://books.google.com/?id=C8-PkAfzShoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=the+strange+case+of+the+spotted+mice#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=Oxford, UK & New York: Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-286193-X |accessdate=25 September 2010 |postscript=&nbsp;&nbsp;Originally published 1961 in ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'', '''70''', 99–106 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1=Medawar | first1=P.

Apart from his books on science and philosophy, it is interesting to note a short feature article on “Some Meistersinger Records” in the issue of ''[[The Gramophone]]'' for November 1930. The author was a P. B. Medawar. The evidence that this was indeed the future Sir Peter Medawar—then a schoolboy of 15—was discussed in “Gramophone” in 1995 (“‘Gramophone’, ''[[Die Meistersinger]]'' and immunology”, by John E. Havard, December 1995).

=== Research outcomes===
Medawar was awarded his [[Nobel Prize]] in 1960 with [[Frank Macfarlane Burnet|Burnet]] for their work in tissue grafting which is the basis of [[organ transplant]]s, and their discovery of acquired immunological tolerance. This work was used in dealing with [[skin graft]]s required after [[Burn (injury)|burns]]. Medawar's work resulted in a shift of emphasis in the science of [[immunology]] from one that attempts to deal with the fully developed immunity mechanism to one that attempts to alter the immunity mechanism itself, as in the attempt to suppress the body's [[organ rejection|rejection of organ transplants]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Park|first=Hyung Wook|title=‘The shape of the human being as a function of time’: time, transplantation, and tolerance in Peter Brian Medawar's research, 1937–1956|journal=Endeavour|year=2010|volume=34|issue=3|pages=112–121|doi=10.1016/j.endeavour.2010.07.002|pmid=20692038}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Simpson|first=Elizabeth|title=Reminiscences of Sir Peter Medawar: I hope of antigen-specific transplantation tolerance|journal=American Journal of Transplantation|year=2004|volume=4|issue=12|pages=1937–1940|doi=10.1111/j.1600-6143.2004.00687.x|pmid=15575894}}</ref>

In 1959 Medawar was invited by the BBC to present the broadcaster's annual [[Reith Lectures]]—following in the footsteps of his colleague, J. Z. Young, who was Reith Lecturer in 1950. For his own series of six radio broadcasts, titled ''The Future of Man'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Peter Medawar: The Future of Man: 1959|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00h9lc9|work=BBC Radio4|publisher=BBC|accessdate=27 February 2014}}</ref> Medawar examined how the human race might continue to evolve.

While attending the annual [[British Association]] meeting in 1969, Medawar suffered a [[stroke]] when reading the lesson at [[Exeter Cathedral]], a duty which falls on every new President of the [[British Association]]. It was, as he said, "monstrous bad luck because [[James W. Black|Jim Whyte Black]] had not yet devised [[beta-blockers]], which slow the heart-beat and could have preserved my health and my career".<ref>Medawar P. B. 1986. ''Memoirs of a thinking radish: an autobiography''. Oxford. p. 153</ref> Medawar’s failing health may have had repercussions for medical science and the relations between the scientific community and government. Before the stroke, Medawar was one of Britain's most influential scientists, especially in the biomedical field.

After the impairment of his speech and movement, Medawar, with his wife's help, reorganised his life and continued to write and do research though on a greatly restricted scale. However, more haemorrhages followed and in 1987 he died in the [[Royal Free Hospital]], London. He is buried—as is his wife Jean (1913–2005)—at [[Alfriston]] in East Sussex.<ref>Leslie Baruch Brent.

==Personal life==
Medawar married [[Jean Shinglewood Taylor]] on 27 February 1937. They met while in graduate class at Magdalen. Taylor approached him for the meaning of "[[heuristic]]", which she had to ask twice, and he had to finally offer lessons in philosophy. They had two sons, Charles and Alexander, and two daughters, Caroline and Louise. He never knew the exact meaning of his surname, an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word, he was told, for "to make round"; but which a friend explained to him as "little round fat man".

Medawar was a scientist of great inventiveness who was interested in many other subjects including [[opera]], [[philosophy]] and [[cricket]]. He was exceptionally tall, 6&nbsp;ft and 5 inches, physically robust, with a big voice noted particularly during his lectures. He was renowned for wit and humour, which he claimed inherited from his "raucous" mother. He did not receive a PhD as he could not afford the requisite ₤25, to which he commented, "Morally I'm a PhD, ... Anyway it was unfashionable in my day. John Young [probably referring to [[John Zachary Young]]] was not a PhD either." He was regarded as the philosopher [[Karl Popper]]'s best-known disciple in science.<ref name=new/>

Medawar was the maternal grandfather of the screenwriter and director [[Alex Garland]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

=== Views on religion ===
Medawar declared:
{{quote|... I believe that a reasonable case can be made for saying, not that we believe in God because He exists but rather that He exists because we believe in Him... Considered as an element of the world, God has the same degree and kind of objective reality as do other products of mind... I regret my disbelief in God and religious answers generally, for I believe it would give satisfaction and comfort to many in need of it if it were possible to discover and propound good scientific and philosophic reasons to believe in God... To abdicate from the rule of reason and substitute for it an authentication of belief by the intentness and degree of conviction with which we hold it can be perilous and destructive... I am a rationalist—something of a period piece nowadays, I admit...<ref>Peter Medawar 1984. 'The question of the existence of God' in ''The limits of science'' Harper and Row.</ref>}}

Medawar was also a realist in pointing out in his book "''Advice to a Young Scientist''" that there is no quicker way for a scientist to bring discredit on himself and his profession particularly when no declaration is called for, than to declare that science knows or will know the answers to all questions worth asking. He added that questions that do not admit a scientific answer should not be assumed to be non-questions, "We must turn to imaginative literature and religion for suitable answers!"

He also remarked:
{{quote|Religion has not sustained me on any of the occasions when the comfort it professes would have been  most welcome.<ref name=paida/>}}
