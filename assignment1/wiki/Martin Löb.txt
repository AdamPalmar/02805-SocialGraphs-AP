'''Martin Hugo Löb''' ({{IPA-de|løːp|lang}}; 31 March 1921 – 21 August 2006) was a [[Germany|German]] [[mathematician]].  He settled in the [[United Kingdom]] after the [[Second World War]] and specialised in [[mathematical logic]].  He moved to [[the Netherlands]] in the 1970s, where he remained in retirement.  He is perhaps best known for having formulated [[Löb's theorem]] in 1955.

== Early life and education==
Löb grew up in [[Berlin]], but escaped from the [[Nazi]]s, arriving in the UK just before the outbreak of the [[Second World War]].  As an [[enemy alien]], he was deported on the ''[[HMT Dunera|Dunera]]'' to an [[internment camp]] at [[Hay, New South Wales|Hay]] in [[Australia]] in 1940, where the 19-year-old Löb was taught mathematics by other internees.  His teacher, [[Felix Behrend]], was later a professor at [[Melbourne University]].

Löb was allowed to return to the UK in 1943, and he studied at the [[University of London]] after the War. After graduating, he became a research student with [[Reuben Goodstein]] at the  [[University of Leicester]]. He completed his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] and became an assistant lecturer at the [[University of Leeds]] in 1951, where he was to remain for 20 years, becoming a [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] and ultimately [[Professor]] of Mathematical Logic from 1967 to 1970. He developed the [[mathematical logic]] group at Leeds, making it one of the leading centres in the UK. Löb did research on [[proof theory]], [[modal logic]] and [[computability theory]]. He formulated [[Löb's theorem]] in 1955, as a formal version of [[Löb's paradox]], that statements that assert their own provability must be true (similar to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]]).

Löb's wife, Caroline, was Dutch.  They had two daughters together.  Löb moved to become a professor at the [[University of Amsterdam]] in the early 1970s.  He remained at the University of Amsterdam until he retired.  He then moved to [[Annen]], where he later died.
