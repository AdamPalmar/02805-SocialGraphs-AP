'''Martin Buber''' ({{lang-he-n|מרטין בובר}}, {{lang-de|Martin Buber}}, {{lang-yi|מארטין בובער}}; February 8, 1878&nbsp;– June 13, 1965) was an Austrian-born Israeli [[Jewish people|Jewish]] [[philosopher]] best known for his [[philosophy of dialogue]], a form of [[existentialism]] centered on the distinction between the [[I and Thou|I–Thou]] relationship and the I–It relationship.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.roberthsarkissian.com/iof/BUBER.HTM | title = Island of freedom | contribution = Buber}}.</ref>  Born in [[Vienna]], Buber came from a family of observant Jews, but broke with Jewish custom to pursue secular studies in [[philosophy]].  In 1902, he became the editor of the weekly ''[[Die Welt (Herzl)|Die Welt]]'', the central organ of the [[Zionist]] movement, although he later withdrew from organizational work in Zionism.  In 1923, Buber wrote his famous essay on existence, ''[[I and Thou|Ich und Du]]'' (later translated into English as ''I and Thou''), and in 1925, he began translating the [[Hebrew Bible]] into the [[German language]].

He was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] ten times, and [[Nobel Peace Prize]] seven times.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=1421|title=Nomination Database|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2017-01-24}}</ref>

==Life ==
Martin ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] name: ''מָרְדֳּכַי,'' ''Mordechai'') Buber was born in [[Vienna]] to an Orthodox Jewish family. "Because his parents divorced when he was three years old, he was educated and raised by his grandfather in [[Lviv|Lvov]] where he learned the [[Talmud]], literature and the ways of Chassidism, to whose Rabbis and leaders he became exposed."<ref name="unbroken">{{Citation | last = Rosenstein | first = Neil | title = The Unbroken Chain: Biographical Sketches and Genealogy of Illustrious Jewish Families from the 15th–20th Century | volume = 1, 2 | edition = revised | publisher = CIS | place = New York | year = 1990 | ISBN = 0-9610578-4-X}}.</ref> His grandfather, [[Solomon Buber]], was a renowned scholar of [[Midrash]] and [[Rabbinic Literature]]. At home Buber spoke [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and German. In 1892 Buber returned to his father's house in Lemberg, today's [[Lviv]], Ukraine.

Despite Buber's connection to the [[Davidic line|House of David]] as a descendant of [[Meir ben Isaac Katzenellenbogen|Meir Katzenellenbogen]], illustrated in ''The Unbroken Chain'',<ref name="unbroken" /> a personal religious crisis led him to break with Jewish [[Halakha|religious customs]]: he began reading [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].<ref name="Wood1969">{{cite book| first =Robert E | last = Wood|title=Martin Buber's Ontology: An Analysis of I and Thou |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JJSCasqZ7iQC|date=1 December 1969|publisher= Northwestern University Press|isbn = 978-0-8101-0650-5 | page =5}}</ref> The latter two, in particular, inspired him to pursue studies in philosophy. In 1896, Buber went to study in Vienna (philosophy, [[art history]], German studies, [[philology]]).

In 1898, he joined the [[Zionism|Zionist]] movement, participating in congresses and organizational work. In 1899 while studying in [[Zürich]], Buber met his future wife, Paula Winkler, a "brilliant Catholic writer from a Bavarian peasant family" <ref>The Pity of It All: A History of Jews in Germany 1743-1933. P. 238. (2002) {{ISBN|0-8050-5964-4}}</ref> who later [[Conversion to Judaism|converted to Judaism]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.tameri.com/csw/exist/buber.shtml |title=The Existential Primer |publisher=Tameri |accessdate=August 28, 2011}}</ref>

In 1930, Buber became an honorary professor at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], but resigned from his professorship in protest immediately after [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in 1933. He then founded the Central Office for Jewish Adult Education, which became an increasingly important body as the German government forbade Jews from public education. In 1938, Buber left Germany and settled in [[Jerusalem]], [[British Mandate for Palestine|Mandate Palestine]], receiving a professorship at [[Hebrew University]] and lecturing in [[anthropology]] and introductory [[sociology]].

== Family ==
Buber was a direct descendant of the prominent 16th-century rabbi [[Meir ben Isaac Katzenellenbogen|Meir Katzenellenbogen]], known as the Maharam of [[Padua]], as was his cousin, cosmetics entrepreneur [[Helena Rubinstein]]. [[Karl Marx]] is another notable relative.<ref name="unbroken" />

Buber's wife Paula died in 1958, and he died at his home in the [[Talbiya]] neighborhood of Jerusalem on June 13, 1965. They had two children: a son, Rafael Buber, and a daughter, Eva Strauss-Steinitz.<ref name="unbroken" />

== Themes ==
Buber's evocative, sometimes poetic, writing style marked the major themes in his work: the retelling of [[Hasidism|Hasidic]] and Chinese tales, [[bible|Biblical]] commentary, and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] dialogue. A [[Cultural Zionism|cultural Zionist]], Buber was active in the Jewish and educational communities of Germany and [[Israel]].{{Sfn | Buber | 1996 | p = 92}}  He was also a staunch supporter of a [[binational solution]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and after the establishment of the Jewish state of Israel, of a regional federation of Israel and Arab states. His influence extends across the humanities, particularly in the fields of [[social psychology]], [[social philosophy]], and [[existentialism|religious existentialism]].{{Sfn | Buber | 1996 | p = 34}}

Buber's attitude toward [[Zionism]] was tied to his desire to promote a vision of "Hebrew humanism".<ref>{{cite book| last= Schaeder| first= Grete| title= The Hebrew humanism of Martin Buber|year=1973|publisher=Wayne State University Press|location= Detroit|isbn= 0-8143-1483-X| page =11}}</ref> According to Laurence J. Silberstein, the terminology of "Hebrew humanism" was coined to "distinguish [Buber's] form of [[nationalism]] from that of the official Zionist movement" and to point to how "Israel's problem was but a distinct form of the universal human problem. Accordingly, the task of Israel as a distinct nation was inexorably linked to the task of humanity in general".<ref>{{cite book|last= Silberstein|first= Laurence J | title= Martin Buber's Social and Religious Thought: Alienation and the quest for meaning | year = 1989 | publisher =New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-8147-7886-0|page = 100}}</ref>

== Zionist views ==
Approaching Zionism from his own personal viewpoint, Buber disagreed with [[Theodor Herzl]] about the political and cultural direction of Zionism. Herzl envisioned the goal of Zionism in a nation-state, but did not consider [[Jewish culture]] or religion necessary. In contrast, Buber believed the potential of Zionism was for social and spiritual enrichment. For example, Buber argued that following the formation of the Israeli state, there would need to be reforms to Judaism: "We need someone who would do for Judaism what [[Pope John XXIII]] has done for the Catholic Church".<ref>{{Cite book| last = Hodes| first = Aubrey| title = Martin Buber: An Intimate Portrait | page = 174 |year= 1971|isbn= 0-670-45904-6|url= http://openlibrary.org/works/OL7021935W/Martin_Buber_an_intimate_portrait}}</ref> Herzl and Buber would continue, in mutual respect and disagreement, to work towards their respective goals for the rest of their lives.

In 1902 Buber became the editor of the weekly ''Die Welt'', the central organ of the Zionist movement. However, a year later he became involved with the Jewish [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]] movement. Buber admired how the Hasidic communities actualized their religion in daily life and culture. In stark contrast to the busy Zionist organizations, which were always mulling political concerns, the Hasidim were focused on the values which Buber had long advocated for Zionism to adopt. In 1904, he withdrew from much of his Zionist organizational work and devoted himself to study and writing. In that year he published his thesis, ''Beiträge zur Geschichte des Individuationsproblems'', on [[Jakob Böhme]] and [[Nicholas of Cusa|Nikolaus Cusanus]].<ref name="Stewart2011">{{cite book| first =Jon | last = Stewart|title = Kierkegaard and Existentialism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UFQWBkpEbwsC|date= 1 May 2011|publisher= Ashgate |isbn = 978-1-4094-2641-7 | page= 34}}</ref>

In the early 1920s Martin Buber started advocating a [[Binational solution|binational]] Jewish-Arab state, stating that the Jewish people should proclaim "its desire to live in peace and brotherhood with the Arab people and to develop the common homeland into a republic in which both peoples will have the possibility of free development".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jafi.org.il/education/100/people/bios/buber.html |title=Jewish Zionist Education |publisher=Jafi |place=[[Israel|IL]] |date=May 15, 2005 |accessdate=August 28, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222163127/http://www.jafi.org.il/education/100/people/BIOS/buber.html |archivedate=December 22, 2009 |df= }}</ref>

Buber rejected the idea of Zionism as just another national movement and wanted instead to see the creation of an exemplary society; a society which would not, he said, be characterized by Jewish domination of the Arabs. It was necessary for the Zionist movement to reach a consensus with the Arabs even at the cost of the Jews remaining a minority in the country. In 1925 he was involved in the creation of the organization [[Brit Shalom (political organization)|Brit Shalom]] (Covenant of Peace), which advocated the creation of a binational state, and throughout the rest of his life he hoped and believed that Jews and Arabs one day would live in peace in a joint nation. In 1942, he co‑founded the [[Ihud]] party which advocated a binationalist program. Nevertheless, he was connected with decades of friendship to Zionists and philosophers such as [[Chaim Weizmann]], [[Max Brod]], [[Hugo Bergman]], and [[Felix Weltsch]], who were close friends of his from old European times in [[Prague]], [[Berlin]], and Vienna to the Jerusalem of the 1940s through the 1960s.

After the establishment of [[Israel]] in 1948, Buber advocated Israel's participation in a federation of "Near East" states wider than just Palestine.<ref>{{cite book | chapter = We Need The Arabs, They Need Us! |last = Buber | first = Martin | title = A Land of Two Peoples | editor-first = Paul | editor-last = Mendes-Flohr | editor-link = Paul Mendes-Flohr |publisher = [[University of Chicago]] |origyear = 1954 |year = 2005 |isbn = 0-226-07802-7}}</ref>

From 1906 until 1914, Buber published editions of Hasidic, mystical, and mythic texts from Jewish and world sources. In 1916 he moved from Berlin to [[Heppenheim]].

During [[World War I]], he helped establish the [[Jewish National Committee]]<ref>https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Buber.html</ref>   to improve the condition of [[Eastern Europe]]an Jews. During that period he became the editor of ''[[Der Jude (magazine)|Der Jude]]'' (German for "The Jew"), a Jewish monthly (until 1924). In 1921, Buber began his close relationship with [[Franz Rosenzweig]]. In 1922, he and Rosenzweig co-operated in Rosenzweig's [[House of Jewish Learning]], known in Germany as ''[[Lehrhaus]]''.<ref name = "Zank2006">{{cite book | first =Michael | last = Zank|title=New perspectives on Martin Buber|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HRjAUsonXGwC|date= 31 August 2006|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|isbn=978-3-16-148998-3|page= 20}}</ref>

In 1923, Buber wrote his famous essay on existence, ''[[I and Thou|Ich und Du]]'' (later translated into English as ''I and Thou''). Though he edited the work later in his life, he refused to make substantial changes. In 1925, he began, in conjunction with Franz Rosenzweig, translating the [[Hebrew Bible]] into German. He himself called this translation ''Verdeutschung'' ("Germanification"), since it does not always use literary German language, but instead attempts to find new dynamic (often newly invented) equivalent phrasing to respect the multivalent Hebrew original.  Between 1926 and 1930, Buber co-edited the quarterly ''Die Kreatur'' ("The Creature").<ref name = "BuberBiemann2002">{{cite book| first1= Martin | last1 = Buber| first2= Asher D | last2 = Biemann|title= The Martin Buber reader: essential writings | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=BTzPiYZUIPwC|year= 2002|publisher= Palgrave Macmillan|isbn= 978-0-312-29290-4|page = 7}}</ref>

In 1930, Buber became an honorary professor at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]].  He resigned in protest from his professorship immediately after [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in 1933. On October 4, 1933 the [[Nazism|Nazi]] authorities forbade him to lecture. In 1935 he was expelled from the ''Reichsschrifttumskammer'' (the National Socialist authors' association).  He then founded the [[Central Office for Jewish Adult Education]], which became an increasingly important body as the German government forbade Jews to attend public education.<ref name="BuberMendes-Flohr2005">{{cite book| first = Martin | last = Buber| editor-first =Paul R | editor-last = Mendes-Flohr|title=A land of two peoples: Martin Buber on Jews and Arabs|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IE5B_0AjQjkC|date= 15 February 2005|publisher= University of Chicago Press|isbn= 978-0-226-07802-1}}</ref> The Nazi administration increasingly obstructed this body.

Finally, in 1938, Buber left Germany and settled in [[Jerusalem]], then capital of [[British Mandate of Palestine|Mandate Palestine]]. He received a professorship at [[Hebrew University]], there lecturing in [[anthropology]] and introductory [[sociology]]. The lectures he gave during the first semester were published in the book ''The problem of man'' (''Das Problem des Menschen'');<ref name = "Schaeder1991">{{Citation | editor-last = Schaeder | editor-first = Grete | contribution = Martin Buber: A Biographical Sketch | first = Martin | last = Buber | year = 1991 | title = The letters of Martin Buber: a life of dialogue | isbn= 978-0-8156-0420-4|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tGi6968aQSoC&pg=PA52 | page = 52}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | first = Martin | last = Buber | editor-first = Asher D | editor-last = Biemann | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=BTzPiYZUIPwC&pg=PA12 | title = The Martin Buber reader: essential writings | page = 12}}.</ref> in these lectures he discusses how the question "What is Man?" became the central one in [[philosophical anthropology]].<ref>{{Citation | last = Schaeder | first = Grete | year = 1973 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=A7e4AAAAIAAJ | title = The Hebrew humanism of Martin Buber | page = 29}}.</ref> He participated in the discussion of the Jews' problems in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and of the Arab question – working out of his Biblical, philosophic, and Hasidic work.

He became a member of the group ''[[Ihud]]'', which aimed at a [[Binational solution|bi-national]] state for [[Arab]]s and Jews in Palestine. Such a binational confederation was viewed by Buber as a more proper fulfillment of Zionism than a solely Jewish state. In 1946 he published his work ''[[Paths in Utopia]]'',<ref name = "Paths">{{cite book| first =Martín | last = Buber|title=Paths in Utopia|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MXGSnCcRaUwC|date=September 1996|publisher= Syracuse University Press|isbn= 978-0-8156-0421-1}}</ref> in which he detailed his [[communitarian]] [[socialist]] views and his theory of the "dialogical community" founded upon interpersonal "dialogical relationships".

After [[World War II]] Buber began lecture tours in Europe and the United States. In 1952 he argued with [[Jung]] over the existence of God.<ref>{{Citation | last = Schneider | first = Herbert W | contribution = The historical significance of Buber's philosophy | title = The philosophy of Martin Buber | page = 471 | quote = ...the retort he actually made, namely, that a scientist should not make judgments beyond his science. Such an insistence on hard and fast boundaries among sciences is not in the spirit of Buber's empiricism}}.</ref>

== Philosophy ==
{{Jewish philosophy}}
Buber is famous for his thesis of dialogical existence, as he described in the book ''I and Thou''. However, his work dealt with a range of issues including religious consciousness, modernity, the concept of evil, ethics, education, and Biblical hermeneutics.<ref name = "Friedman1996">{{cite book | first = Maurice S | last = Friedman | title =Martin Buber and the human sciences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WFoU5LdDu6cC|date=July 1996|publisher= SUNY Press | isbn = 978-0-7914-2876-4 |page= 186}}</ref>

Buber rejected the label of "philosopher" or "theologian" claiming he was not interested in ideas, only personal experience, and could not discuss God but only relationships to God.<ref>{{cite book|last=Vermes|first=Pamela|title=Buber|year=1988|publisher=Peter Hablan |location=London|isbn=1-870015-08-8|page = vii}}</ref>

=== Dialogue and existence ===
In ''I and Thou'', Buber introduced his thesis on human existence. Inspired by [[Ludwig Feuerbach|Feuerbach]]'s ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'' and [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]]'s ''Single One'', Buber worked upon the premise of existence as encounter.<ref>{{cite book| last =Buber | first = Martin|url= https://www.google.com/books?id=6fPU5xfv4SMC&pg=PA228 | title = Between Man and Man| publisher = Routledge | origyear = 1947 | year = 2002|pages=250–51}}</ref> He explained this philosophy using the word pairs of ''Ich-Du'' and ''Ich-Es'' to categorize the modes of consciousness, interaction, and [[being]] through which an individual engages with other individuals, inanimate objects, and all reality in general. Theologically, he associated the first with the Jewish Jesus and the second with the apostle Paul (formerly Saul of Tarsus, a Jew).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Langton|first1=Daniel|title=The Apostle Paul in the Jewish Imagination|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=67–71}}</ref> Philosophically, these word pairs express complex ideas about modes of being—particularly how a person exists and actualizes that existence. As Buber argues in ''I and Thou'', a person is at all times engaged with the world in one of these modes.

The generic motif Buber employs to describe the dual modes of being is one of dialogue (''Ich-Du'') and monologue (''Ich-Es'').<ref name = "KramerGawlick2003">{{cite book | first1 = Kenneth | last1 = Kramer| first2= Mechthild | last2 = Gawlick| title= Martin Buber's I and thou: practicing living dialogue | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VgvSa1_l0BEC |date=November 2003|publisher=Paulist Press|isbn= 978-0-8091-4158-6| page = 39}}</ref> The concept of communication, particularly language-oriented communication, is used both in describing dialogue/monologue through metaphors and expressing the interpersonal nature of human existence.

==== ''Ich-Du'' ====
''Ich‑Du'' ("I‑Thou" or "I‑You") is a relationship that stresses the mutual, holistic existence of two beings. It is a concrete encounter, because these beings meet one another in their authentic existence, without any qualification or objectification of one another.  Even imagination and ideas do not play a role in this relation. In an I–Thou encounter, infinity and universality are made actual (rather than being merely concepts).<ref name = "KramerGawlick2003" />  Buber stressed that an ''Ich‑Du'' relationship lacks any composition (e.g.,&nbsp;structure) and communicates no content (e.g.,&nbsp;information). Despite the fact that ''Ich‑Du'' cannot be proven to happen as an event (e.g.,&nbsp;it cannot be measured), Buber stressed that it is real and perceivable. A variety of examples are used to illustrate ''Ich‑Du'' relationships in daily life—two lovers, an observer and a cat, the author and a tree, and two strangers on a train. Common English words used to describe the ''Ich‑Du'' relationship include encounter, meeting, dialogue, mutuality, and exchange.

One key ''Ich‑Du'' relationship Buber identified was that which can exist between a human being and God. Buber argued that this is the only way in which it is possible to interact with God, and that an ''Ich‑Du'' relationship with anything or anyone connects in some way with the eternal relation to God.

To create this I–Thou relationship with God, a person has to be open to the idea of such a relationship, but not actively pursue it. The pursuit of such a relation creates qualities associated with It‑ness, and so would prevent an I‑You relation, limiting it to I‑It. Buber claims that if we are open to the I–Thou, God eventually comes to us in response to our welcome. Also, because the God Buber describes is completely devoid of qualities, this I–Thou relationship lasts as long as the individual wills it. When the individual finally returns to the I‑It way of relating, this acts as a barrier to deeper relationship and community.

==== ''Ich-Es'' ====
The ''Ich-Es'' ("I‑It") relationship is nearly the opposite of ''Ich‑Du''.<ref name="KramerGawlick2003"/> Whereas in ''Ich‑Du'' the two beings encounter one another, in an ''Ich‑Es'' relationship the beings do not actually meet. Instead, the "I" confronts and qualifies an idea, or conceptualization, of the being in its presence and treats that being as an object. All such objects are considered merely mental representations, created and sustained by the individual mind. This is based partly on Kant's theory of [[phenomenon]], in that these objects reside in the cognitive agent’s mind, existing only as thoughts. Therefore, the ''Ich‑Es'' relationship is in fact a relationship with oneself; it is not a dialogue, but a monologue.

In the ''Ich-Es'' relationship, an individual treats other things, people, etc., as objects to be used and experienced. Essentially, this form of objectivity relates to the world in terms of the self – how an object can serve the individual’s interest.

Buber argued that human life consists of an oscillation between ''Ich‑Du'' and ''Ich‑Es'', and that in fact ''Ich‑Du'' experiences are rather few and far between. In diagnosing the various perceived ills of [[modernity]] (e.g.,&nbsp;isolation, dehumanization, etc.), Buber believed that the expansion of a purely analytic, material view of existence was at heart an advocation of ''Ich‑Es'' relations – even between human beings. Buber argued that this paradigm devalued not only existents, but the meaning of all existence.

==== Note on translation ====
''Ich und Du'' has been translated from the original German into many other languages. However, because Buber's use of German was highly idiomatic and often unconventional, there has naturally been debate on how best to convey the complex messages in his text. One critical debate in the English-speaking world has centered on the correct translation of the key word pairs ''Ich-Du'' and ''Ich-Es''. In the German the word "Du" is used, while in the English two different translations are used: "Thou" (used in Ronald Smith’s version) and "You" (used by [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]]). The key problem is how to translate the very personal, even intimate German "Du", which has no direct equivalent in Modern English. Smith argued that "Thou" invokes the theological and reverential implications which Buber intended (e.g.,&nbsp;Buber describes God as the eternal "Du"). Kaufmann asserted that this wording was archaic and impersonal, offering "You" because (like the German ''Du'') it has colloquial usage in intimate conversation.

Despite this debate, Buber’s book is widely known in the English-speaking world as ''I and Thou'', perhaps because Smith's translation appeared years before Kaufmann's. However, both translations are widely available.

== Hasidism and mysticism ==
Buber was a scholar, interpreter, and translator of Hasidic lore. He viewed Hasidism as a source of cultural renewal for Judaism, frequently citing examples from the Hasidic tradition that emphasized community, interpersonal life, and meaning in common activities (e.g.,&nbsp;a worker's relation to his tools). The Hasidic ideal, according to Buber, emphasized a life lived in the unconditional presence of God, where there was no distinct separation between daily habits and religious experience. This was a major influence on Buber's philosophy of anthropology, which considered the basis of human existence as dialogical.

In 1906, Buber published ''Die Geschichten des Rabbi Nachman'', a collection of the tales of the [[Rabbi]] [[Nachman of Breslov]], a renowned Hasidic ''[[rebbe]]'', as interpreted and retold in a [[Neo‐Hasidism|Neo-Hasidic]] fashion by Buber. Two years later, Buber published ''Die Legende des Baalschem'' (stories of the [[Baal Shem Tov]]), the founder of Hasidism.<ref name="Zank2006" />

Buber's interpretation of the Hasidic tradition, however, has been criticized by [[Chaim Potok]] for its romanticization. In the introduction to Buber's ''[[Tales of the Hasidim]]'', Potok notes that Buber overlooked Hasidism's "charlatanism, obscurantism, internecine quarrels, its heavy freight of folk superstition and pietistic excesses, its [[tzadik]] worship, its vulgarized and attenuated reading of Lurianic Kabbalah." Even more severe is the criticism that Buber deemphasized the importance of the Jewish Law in Hasidism.
