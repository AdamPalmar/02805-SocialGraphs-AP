'''Edgar Morin''' ({{IPA-fr|mɔʁɛ̃|lang}}; born '''Edgar Nahoum''' on 8 July 1921) is a [[France|French]] [[philosopher]] and [[sociologist]] who has been internationally recognized for his work on complexity and "complex thought," and for his scholarly contributions to such diverse fields as media studies, politics, sociology, visual anthropology, ecology, education, and systems biology. He holds degrees in history, economics, and law. Though less well known in the United States due to the limited availability of English translations of his over 60 books, Morin is renowned in the French-speaking world, Europe, and Latin America.

== Biography ==
At the beginning of the 20th century, Morin's family migrated from the Greek city of [[Salonica]] (Thessaloniki) to [[Marseille]]<ref>Edgar Morin, Véronique Nahoum-Grappe, Haïm Vidal Sephiha (1989), ''Vidal et les siens'', Paris: Seuil.</ref> and later to [[Paris]], where Edgar was born. He is of Judeo-Spanish ([[Sephardi Jews|Sefardi]]) origin.

When the Germans invaded France in 1940, Morin assisted refugees and joined the French Resistance.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Morin|first1=Edgar|last2=Boukhardi|first2=Sophie|title=Talking to Edgar Morin: Defining dialogue|journal=UNESCO: the new Courier|date=January 2004|pages=8–11}}</ref> As a member of the [[French Resistance]] he adopted the pseudonym ''Morin'', which he would use for the rest of his life. He joined the [[French Communist Party]] in 1941.

In 1945, Morin married Violette Chapellaubeau and they lived in [[Landau]], where he served as a Lieutenant in the French Occupation army in Germany.

In 1946, he returned to Paris and gave up his military career to pursue his activities with the Communist Party. Due to his critical posture, his relationship with the party gradually deteriorated until he was expelled in 1951 after he published an article in ''[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]''. In the same year, he was admitted to the National Center of Scientific Research ([[CNRS]]).

Morin founded and directed the magazine ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Arguments (journal)|fr|3=Arguments|lt=Arguments}}'' (1954–1962). In 1959 his book ''Autocritique'' was published. The book was a sustained reflection on his adherence to, and subsequent exit from, the Communist Party, focusing on the dangers of ideology and self-deception.

In 1960, Morin travelled extensively in Latin America, visiting [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]] and [[Mexico]]. He returned to France, where he published ''L'Esprit du Temps'', a work on popular culture''.''

That same year, French sociologist [[Georges Friedmann]] brought him and [[Roland Barthes]] together to create a Centre for the Study of Mass Communication that, after several name changes, became the [[Edgar Morin Centre]] of the [[EHESS]], Paris.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=iiac |title=Centre Edgar-Morin |url=http://www.iiac.cnrs.fr/cetsah/spip.php?article207 |accessdate=2010-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091023005003/http://www.iiac.cnrs.fr/cetsah/spip.php?article207 |archivedate=October 23, 2009 }}</ref>

Also in 1960 Morin and [[Jean Rouch]] coauthored the film [[Chronique d'un été]], an early example of ''[[cinéma vérité]]'' and [[Direct Cinema|direct cinema]].

Beginning in 1965, Morin became involved in a large multidisciplinary project, financed by the Délégation Générale à la Recherche Scientifique et Technologique in [[Plozévet]].

In 1968, Morin replaced [[Henri Lefebvre]] at the [[University of Paris X: Nanterre|University of Nanterre]]. He became involved in the student revolts that began to emerge in France. In May 1968 he wrote a series of articles for [[Le Monde]] that tried to understand what he called "The Student Commune." He followed [[May 1968 in France|the student revolt]] closely and wrote a second series of articles in Le Monde called "The Revolution without a Face," as well as coauthoring ''Mai 68: La brèche'' with [[Cornelius Castoriadis]] and [[Claude Lefort]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Van Herpen |first=Marcel |title =PARIS MAY ’68 AND PROVO AMSTERDAM ‘65 |url =http://www.cicerofoundation.org/lectures/Marcel_Van_Herpen_May_68_and_Provo_Amsterdam_65.pdf | pages=19 |accessdate =2010-01-23}}</ref>

In 1969 Morin spent a year at the [[Salk Institute|Salk Institute for Biological Studies]] in [[La Jolla]], California.

In 1983 he published ''De la nature de l’URSS,'' which deepened his analysis of Soviet communism and anticipated the [[perestroika]] of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].

In 2002 Morin participated in the creation of the [[Collegium International|International Ethical, Scientific and Political Collegium]]. Also that year, he made a trip to Iran with Dariush Shayegan.

==Work==
In addition to being the [[UNESCO]] Chair of Complex Thought, Morin is known as a founder of [[transdisciplinarity]] and holds honorary doctorates in a variety of social science fields from 21 universities (Messina, Geneva, Milan, Bergamo, Thessaloniki, La Paz, Odense, Perugia, Cosenza, Palermo, Nuevo León, Université de Laval à Québec, Brussels, Barcelona, Guadalajara, Valencia, Vera Cruz, Santiago, the Catholic University of Porto Alegre, the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte, and Candido Mendes University (Rio de Janeiro)).<ref name=Montuori>{{cite journal|last1=Montuori|first1=Alfonso|title=COMPLEX THOUGHT An Overview of Edgar Morin’s Intellectual Journey|journal=MetaIntegral Foundation|date=June 2013|volume=Resource Paper}}</ref>

The [[University of Messina]] in Sicily, Ricardo Palma University in Lima, and the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)]], the French National Research Center in Paris, have established research centers based on his transdisciplinary methods and philosophy.<ref name=Montuori/> In addition, the [[Multiversidad Mundo Real Edgar Morin]], a university based on his work, was established in Mexico. Morin did not embrace the French [[Postmodern philosophy|postmodern]] or [[poststructuralist]] movements, instead pursuing his own research agenda. As a result, US academics did not transport his theories into disciplinary discourses in same fashion as they did Foucault's and Derrida's. Morin's work spans scholarly and popular literature, and he has appeared on the cover of multiple publications including [http://www.scienceshumaines.com/edgar-morin-l-aventure-d-une-pensee_fr_497.htm Sciences Humaines] and a special issue of [http://boutique.lemonde.fr/le-monde-hors-serie-edgar-morin.html Le Monde].

According to Alfonso Montuori in "Edgar Morin: A partial introduction" <blockquote> "The 6 volume Method is perhaps Morin’s culminating work, a remarkable and seemingly inexhaustible treasure trove of insights, reflection, and a real manual for those who are interested in broadening the nature of human inquiry. Drawing on [[cybernetics]], [[information theory]], [[systems theory]], but also integrating all the work he has done before, from the work on imagination in his research on movies to his profound reflections on death, Method integrates Morin’s journey and provides the reader with an alternative to the traditional assumptions and method of inquiry of our time."
