'''Harry Burrows Acton''' (June 2, 1908 â€“ June 16, 1974), usually cited as '''H. B. Acton''', was an English academic in the field of [[political philosophy]], known for books defending the [[morality]] of [[capitalism]], and attacking [[Marxism-Leninism]].<ref name="BioDict20CPhil">{{cite book | title=Biographical Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Philosophers | year=1996 | publisher=Routledge | location=London | pages=4 | isbn=0-415-06043-5}}</ref> He in particular produced arguments on the incoherence of [[Marxism]], which he described as a 'farrago' (in philosophical terms). His book ''The Illusion of the Epoch'', in which this appears, is a standard point of reference. Other interests were the [[Marquis de Condorcet]], [[Hegel]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Herbert Spencer]], [[F. H. Bradley]], [[Bernard Bosanquet (philosopher)|Bernard Bosanquet]] and [[Sidney Webb]].

He had teaching positions at the [[London School of Economics]], [[Bedford College (London)|Bedford College]], the [[University of Edinburgh]] where he occupied the Chair of Moral Philosophy, and the [[University of Chicago]]. He was editor of ''Philosophy'', the journal of the [[Royal Institute of Philosophy]], of which he was for a time Director. He was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1952 to 1953.

He is buried in [[Grange Cemetery]] in [[Edinburgh]] close to the main entrance.
