'''Peter Thomas Geach''', [[Fellow of the British Academy#Fellowship|FBA]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|iː|tʃ}}; 29 March 1916 – 21 December 2013) was a British philosopher and [[Professor]] of [[Logic]] at the [[University of Leeds]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2013/12/in-memoriam-peter-geach-1917-2013.html |title=Leiter Reports: A Philosophy Blog: In Memoriam: Peter Geach (1916-2013) |publisher=Leiterreports.typepad.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-23}}</ref> His areas of interest were the [[history of philosophy]], [[philosophical logic]], [[metaethics]], and the theory of [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]].

==Early life==

Peter Geach was born in [[London]] in 1916 to George Hender Geach, a professor of philosophy in Lahore and Cambridge, and [[E. F. A. Geach|Eleonora Adolfina Sgonina]], a poet, and spent his earliest years in [[Cardiff]].  He attended [[The Cathedral School, Llandaff|Llandaff Cathedral School]] and [[Clifton College]].  He received instruction in logic and philosophy from his father who, as a member of the Indian Educational Service, had been professor of philosophy at Lahore and later principal of a teacher training college in Peshawar.  His parents' marriage was unhappy and quickly broke up. Until around the age of eight, Peter lived with his maternal grandparents in Cardiff, after which time he was sent off to school by his father and raised by a guardian. Geach never saw his mother again after childhood.

In 1934 Geach won a scholarship to [[Balliol College, Oxford]], graduating in 1938 with a First in Literae Humaniores.

==Academic career==

Geach spent a year (1938–39) as a Gladstone Research Student, based at [[Gladstone's Library|St Deiniol’s Library]], Hawarden.  Following the end of World War II in 1945, he undertook further research at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].

In 1951, Geach was appointed to his first substantive academic post, as Assistant [[Lecturer]] at the [[University of Birmingham]], going on to become [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] in Logic.  In 1966 he was appointed Professor of Logic in the Department of [[Philosophy]] at the [[University of Leeds]].<ref name=anscombe/> Geach retired from his chair in 1981 with the title [[Emeritus]] Professor of Logic.<ref>[http://www.leeds.ac.uk/calendar/emeritus.htm University of Leeds, List of Emeritus Professors]</ref> He also held [[Visiting scholar|Visiting Professorships]] at the universities of [[Cornell University|Cornell]], [[University of Chicago|Chicago]], [[University of Michigan|Michigan]], [[University of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]] and [[University of Warsaw|Warsaw]].<ref>[https://www.leeds.ac.uk/secretariat/obituaries/2014/geach_peter.html Obituary, University of Leeds]</ref>

Geach was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] (FBA) in 1965.<ref>[http://www.britac.ac.uk/fellowship/directory/ord.cfm British Academy, List of Fellows]</ref> He was elected an [[Honorary Fellow]] of Balliol College in 1979.

He was awarded the papal cross "[[Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice]]" by the [[Holy See]] for his philosophical work.

==Thought==
His early work includes the classic texts ''Mental Acts'' and ''Reference and Generality'', the latter defending an essentially modern conception of [[reference]] against medieval theories of supposition. His Catholic perspective was integral to his philosophy. He was perhaps the founder of [[Analytical Thomism]] (though the current of thought running through his and [[G. E. M. Anscombe|Elizabeth Anscombe's]] work to the present day was only ostensibly so named forty years later by [[John Joseph Haldane|John Haldane]]), the aim of which is to synthesise Thomistic and Analytic approaches. Geach was a student and an early follower of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] whilst at [[Cambridge University]].<ref>News item 'Peter Geach' in [http://philosophynow.org/issues/100/News_January_February_2014 Philosophy Now, Issue 100 (link)], accessed 2014-01-29.</ref>

Geach defends the Thomistic position that human beings are essentially [[rationalism|rational]] animals, each one miraculously created. He dismissed Darwinistic attempts to regard reason as inessential to humanity, as "mere sophistry, laughable, or pitiable." He repudiated any capacity for [[Animal language|language in animals]] as mere "association of manual signs with things or performances." {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Geach dismissed both pragmatic and epistemic conceptions of truth, commending a version of the [[correspondence theory of truth|correspondence theory]] proposed by [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]]. He argues that there is one reality rooted in God himself, who is the ultimate truthmaker. God, according to Geach, ''is'' truth. While they lived, he saw [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. Quine]] and [[Arthur Prior]] as his allies, in that they held three truths: that there are no non-existent beings; that a proposition can occur in discourse without being there asserted; and that the sense of a term does not depend on the truth of the proposition in which it occurs. He invented the famous ethical example of the stuck potholer, when arguing against the idea that it might be right to kill a child to save its mother. Jenny Teichman, fellow of [[New Hall, Cambridge]], has characterised Geach's philosophical style as "deliberately outrageous".<ref name=teichman/>

==Personal life==
His wife and occasional collaborator was the philosopher and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] scholar Professor [[G. E. M. Anscombe|Elizabeth Anscombe]].<ref name=anscombe/> Both converts to Roman Catholicism, they married in 1941 and had seven children.<ref name=telegraph/> They co-authored the 1961 book ''Three Philosophers'', with Anscombe contributing a section on [[Aristotle]] and Geach one each on Aquinas and [[Gottlob Frege]].<ref name=anscombe/> For a quarter century they were leading figures in the [[Philosophical Enquiry Group]], an annual confluence of Catholic philosophers held at [[Spode House]] in Staffordshire that was established by Father [[Columba Ryan]] in 1954.<ref name=times/>

Peter Geach died early in the morning on 21 December 2013 at [[Addenbrooke's Hospital]] in Cambridge and is buried in what is now the [[Ascension Parish Burial Ground]].
