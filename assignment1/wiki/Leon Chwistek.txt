'''Leon Chwistek''' ([[Kraków]], [[Austria-Hungary]], 13 June 1884 – 20 August 1944, [[Barvikha]] near [[Moscow]], [[Russian SFSR|Russia]]) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[avant-garde]] [[Painting|painter]], theoretician of modern art, [[literary critic]], [[logician]], [[philosopher]] and [[mathematician]].

==Logic and philosophy==
Starting in 1929 Chwistek was a Professor of Logic at the [[University of Lwów]] in a position for which [[Alfred Tarski]] had also applied. His interests in the 1930s were in a general system of philosophy of science, which was published in a book translated in English 1948 as ''The Limits of Science''.<ref>http://www.springerlink.com/content/v078l3n714589036/</ref>

In the 1920s-30s, many [[Europe]]an philosophers attempted to reform traditional philosophy by means of [[mathematical logic]]. Leon Chwistek did not believe that such reform could succeed. He thought that [[reality]] could not be described in one homogeneous system, based on the principles of [[formal logic]], because there was not one reality but many.

Chwistek demolishes the [[axiomatic method]] by demonstrating that the extant axiomatic systems are inconsistent.<ref>First chapter of Chwistek, ''The Limits of Science''</ref>

==Artist==
Chwistek developed his theory of the multiplicity of realities first with regard to the [[art]]s. He distinguished four basic types of realities, then matched them with four basic types of painting.

The four types of realities were:
:1. popular reality (common-sense realism)
:2. physical reality (constructed by physics)
:3. phenomenal reality (sensory impressions)
:4. visionary/intuitive reality (dreams, hallucinations, subconscious states).

The types of painting corresponding to the above were:
:1. [[Primitivism]]
:2. [[Realism (arts)|Realism]]
:3. [[Impressionism]]
:4. [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]]
Chwistek never intended his views to constitute a new [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] theory. He was a defender of "common sense" against metaphysics and irrational feeling. His theory of plural reality was merely an attempt to specify the various ways in which the term, “real,” is used.
 
Chwistek's fellow-artist and closest friend, [[Stanislaw Ignacy Witkiewicz]], harshly criticized his  philosophical views.  Witkiewicz’s own philosophy was based on a [[Monad (philosophy)|monad]]ic character to the individual's existence, embracing a multiplicity of existences, with the world being made up of a multiplicity of Particular Existences.
