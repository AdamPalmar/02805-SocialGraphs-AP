As a winner of [[International Mathematical Olympiad|IMO]] Yuri Matiyasevich was accepted without exams to [[Saint Petersburg State University|LSU]], skipping the last year of high school studies.
* In 1966, he presented a talk at [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] held in [[Moscow]]. He was a second-year undergraduate student at that time.
* In 1969–1970, he pursued Ph.D. studies at [[LOMI|Leningrad Department]] of [[Steklov Institute of Mathematics]] under supervision of [http://www.mathsoc.spb.ru/pers/maslov/ Sergey Maslov]. 
* In 1970, he received his Ph.D. degree at [[LOMI]].
* In 1970–1974, he was a researcher at [[LOMI]]. 
* In 1972, he obtained a second doctoral degree (called "doktor nauk" in [[Soviet Union]]).
* In 1974–1980, he was a senior researcher at [[LOMI]]. 
* Since 1980, Yuri Matiyasevich has been the head of [http://logic.pdmi.ras.ru Laboratory of mathematical logic] at [[LOMI]].
* Since 1995, he has been a professor of [[Saint Petersburg State University|Saint-Petersburg State University]], initially at the chair of software engineering, later at the chair of algebra and number theory. 
* In 1997, he was elected as a corresponding member of [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].
* Since 1998, Yuri Matiyasevich has been a vice-president of [[St. Petersburg Mathematical Society]].
* Since 2002, he has been a head of [http://www.pdmi.ras.ru/~olymp/ St.Petersburg City Mathematical Olympiad].
* Since 2003, Matiyasevich has been a co-director of annual German–Russian student school [http://logic.pdmi.ras.ru/jass07/ JASS].
* In 2008, he was elected as a full member of [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].

== Awards and honors ==

* 1964: Gold medal at the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]] held in [[Moscow]].
