'''Garlandus Compotista''' also known as ''Garland the Computist'' was an early medieval logician of the eleventh-century school of [[Liège]].  Little is known of his life; the ''Dialectica'' published under his name by L. M. de Rijk is now commonly attributed to Gerlandus of Besançon (early 12th century).<ref>See John Marenbon, ''Medieval Philosophy. An Historical and Philosophical Introduction'', NY: Routledge, 2007, p.&nbsp;133.</ref>
