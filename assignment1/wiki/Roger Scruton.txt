[[Knight Bachelor|Sir]] '''Roger Vernon Scruton''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FBA|FRSL}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|k|r|uː|t|ən}}; born 27 February 1944) is an English [[philosopher]] and writer who specialises in [[aesthetics]] and [[political philosophy]], particularly in the furtherance of [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist conservative]] views.<ref name=Cowlingpxxix>Cowling, Maurice. ''Mill and Liberalism'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990, xxix.</ref><ref>Garnett, Mark; Hickson, Kevin. ''Conservative thinkers: The key contributors to the political thought of the modern Conservative Party'', Oxford University Press, 2013, 113–115.</ref>

Editor from 1982 to 2001 of ''[[The Salisbury Review]]'', a conservative political journal, Scruton has written over 50 books on philosophy, art, music, politics, literature, culture, sexuality, and religion; he has also written novels and two operas. His most notable publications include ''The Meaning of Conservatism'' (1980), ''[[Sexual Desire (book)|Sexual Desire]]'' (1986), ''The Aesthetics of Music'' (1997) and ''[[How to Be a Conservative]]'' (2014).<ref>See [[Roger Scruton bibliography]].</ref> He has been a regular contributor to the popular media, including ''[[The Times]]'', ''[[The Spectator]]'' and the ''[[New Statesman]]''.

Scruton embraced conservatism after witnessing the [[May 1968 in France|May 1968 student protests]] in France. From 1971 to 1992 Scruton was a lecturer and professor of aesthetics at [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]], London, after which he held several part-time academic positions, including in the United States.<ref name=about/> He became known in the 1980s for helping to establish [[Jan Hus Educational Foundation|underground academic networks]] in Soviet-controlled [[Eastern Europe]], for which he was awarded the [[Czech Republic]]'s [[Medal of Merit (Czech Republic)|Medal of Merit]] (First Class) by President [[Václav Havel]] in 1998.<ref>Day, Barbara. ''The Velvet Philosophers'', London: The Claridge Press, 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jJNYvDr8YBgC&pg=PA281 281–282].</ref>

Scruton was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in the [[2016 Birthday Honours]] for "services to philosophy, teaching and public education".<ref name=LondonGazette/>

==Early life==
===Family background===
Scruton was born in [[Buslingthorpe, Lincolnshire]],<ref name=born/> to John "Jack" Scruton, a teacher from Manchester, and his wife, Beryl Claris Scruton (née Haynes), and was raised with his two sisters in [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Marlow]] and [[High Wycombe]].<ref name=Wroe/> The Scruton surname had been acquired relatively recently. Jack's father's birth certificate showed him as Matthew Lowe, after Matthew's mother, Margaret Lowe (Scruton's great grandmother); the document made no mention of a father. But Margaret had decided, for reasons unknown, to raise her son as Matthew Scruton instead. Scruton wondered whether she had been employed at the former Scruton Hall in [[Scruton]], Yorkshire, and whether that was where her child had been conceived.<ref>Scruton, Roger. ''England: An Elegy'', A&C Black, 2001, 139–140.</ref>

Jack was raised in a [[Back-to-back house|back-to-back]] on Upper Cyrus Street, [[Ancoats]], an inner-city area of Manchester, and won a scholarship to Manchester High School,<!--no indication as to which school this is--> a [[grammar school]].<ref>''England: An Elegy'', 141.</ref> Scruton told ''The Guardian'' that Jack hated the upper classes and loved the countryside, while Beryl was fond of romantic fiction and entertaining "blue-rinsed friends".<ref name=Wroe>Wroe, Nicholas. [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/oct/28/politics "Thinking for England"], ''The Guardian'', 28 October 2000.</ref> He described his mother as "cherishing an ideal of gentlemanly conduct and social distinction that&nbsp;... [his] father set out with considerable relish to destroy".<ref>Scruton, Roger. ''Gentle Regrets: Thoughts From a Life''. Continuum, 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wgtnHZE_6lwC&pg=PA51&lpg=PA11 11].</ref>

Scruton lived with his parents, two sisters, and Sam the dog, in a [[pebbledashed]] semi-detached house in Hammersley Lane, [[High Wycombe]].<ref name=Wroe/><ref name=Gentlep89>''Gentle Regrets'', 89.</ref> Although his parents had been brought up as Christians, they regarded themselves as humanists, so home was a "religion-free zone".<ref>Scruton, Roger. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110225210343/http://spectator.org/archives/2009/03/10/the-new-humanism "The New Humanism"], ''American Spectator'', March 2009.</ref> Scruton's, indeed the whole family's, relationship with his father was difficult. He wrote in ''Gentle Regrets'': "Friends come and go, hobbies and holidays dabble the soulscape like fleeting sunlight in a summer wind, and the hunger for affection is cut off at every point by the fear of judgement."<ref>''Gentle Regrets'', 94.</ref>

After passing his [[Eleven-plus|11-plus]], he attended the [[Royal Grammar School High Wycombe]] from 1954 to 1962.<ref name=about/><ref>''England: An Elegy'', 25.</ref> He left school with three [[GCE Advanced Level (United Kingdom)|A-levels]], in pure and applied mathematics, physics and chemistry, which he passed with distinction. The results won him an open scholarship in natural sciences to [[Jesus College, Cambridge]], as well as a state scholarship.<ref>[http://www.rgs.saund.co.uk/pdfs/1962-09-wycombiensian.pdf "Examination successes, 1961–62"], ''Wycombiensian'', 13(6), September 1962, 328–330.</ref> Scruton writes that he was expelled from the school shortly afterwards, when the headmaster found the school stage on fire, and a half-naked girl putting out the flames, during one of Scruton's plays.<ref name=Wroe/><ref name=Gentlep34>''Gentle Regrets'', 34.</ref> When he told his family he had won a place at Cambridge, his father stopped speaking to him.<ref name=Edemariam/>

Having intended to study [[Natural Sciences (Cambridge)|natural sciences at Cambridge]]—where he felt "although socially estranged (like virtually every grammar-school boy), spiritually at home"—Scruton switched on the first day to moral sciences (philosophy).<ref name=Wroe/><ref>For the quote, ''Gentle Regrets'', 34.</ref> He graduated in 1965,<ref name=about/> then spent time overseas, some of it teaching at the [[University of Pau and Pays de l'Adour]] in [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]], France, where he met his first wife, Danielle Laffitte.<ref>Scruton, Roger; Dooley, Mark. ''Conversations with Roger Scruton''. London & New York: Bloomsbury Publishing, 2016, 18, 35.</ref>

In 1967 he began studying for his PhD at Jesus, then became a research fellow at [[Peterhouse, Cambridge]] (1969–1971), where he lived with Laffitte when she was not in France.<ref>Scruton and Dooley 2016, 18, 35.</ref> It was while visiting her during the [[May 1968 in France|May 1968 student protests]] in France that Scruton first embraced [[conservatism]]. He was in the [[Latin Quarter in Paris]], watching students overturn cars, smash windows and tear up cobblestones, and for the first time in his life "felt a surge of political anger":<ref>''Gentle Regrets'', 37.</ref>

<blockquote> I suddenly realised I was on the other side. What I saw was an unruly mob of self-indulgent middle-class hooligans. When I asked my friends what they wanted, what were they trying to achieve, all I got back was this ludicrous [[Marxist]] [[gobbledegook]]. I was disgusted by it, and thought there must be a way back to the defence of western civilization against these things. That's when I became a conservative. I knew I wanted to conserve things rather than pull them down.<ref name=Wroe/></blockquote>

==1970s–1980s==
===Birkbeck, first marriage===
[[File:Birkbeck College phototram.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Scruton taught at Birkbeck for 21 years.]]
Scruton was awarded his PhD in January 1973 for a thesis entitled "Art and imagination, a study in the philosophy of mind", supervised by Michael Tanner and the analytic philosopher [[Elizabeth Anscombe]].<ref>[https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/244964 "Art and imagination, a study in the philosophy of mind"], Apollo, University of Cambridge repository.</ref> The thesis was the basis of his first book, ''Art and Imagination'' (1974), which was followed by ''The Aesthetics of Architecture'' (1979). From 1971 he taught philosophy at [[Birkbeck College]], London, a college that specializes in adult education and holds its classes in the evening.<ref name=Gentlep39/> Laffitte taught French at [[Putney High School]], and they lived together in a [[Harley Street]] apartment previously occupied by [[Delia Smith]].<ref>Scruton and Dooley 2016, 41.</ref> The couple married in 1972 but divorced in 1979.<ref name=Wroe/>

Working at Birkbeck left Scruton's days free, so he used the time to study law at the [[Inns of Court School of Law]] (1974–1976) and was [[Call to the bar|called to the Bar]] in 1978; he never practised because he was unable to take a year off work to complete a [[pupillage]].<ref name=about>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100831023120/http://www.roger-scruton.com/rs-cv.html "About"], roger-scruton.com, archived 31 August 2010.</ref><ref>''Gentle Regrets'', 57; Scruton and Dooley 2016, 39.</ref>

Birkbeck was known for its embrace of [[left-wing politics]]. Scruton has said he was the only conservative there, except for the woman who served meals in the [[Senior Common Room]].<ref name=Gentlep39>''Gentle Regrets'', 39.</ref> In 1974, along with [[Hugh Fraser (British politician)|Hugh Fraser]], [[Jonathan Aitken]] and [[John Casey (academic)|John Casey]], he became a founding member of the [[Conservative Philosophy Group]] dining club, which aimed to develop an intellectual basis for conservatism.<ref>''Gentle Regrets'', 45; Scruton and Dooley 2016, 46–47.</ref> The historian [[Hugh Thomas, Baron Thomas of Swynnerton|Hugh Thomas]] and the philosopher [[Anthony Quinton]] attended meetings, as did [[Margaret Thatcher]] before she became prime minister. She reportedly said during one meeting in 1975: "The other side have got an ideology they can test their policies against. We must have one as well."<ref>Young, Hugo. ''One of Us'', London: Pan Macmillan, 2013, 221.</ref>

Scruton's academic career at Birkbeck was blighted by his conservatism, particularly by his third book, ''The Meaning of Conservatism'' (1980),<ref>Scruton, Roger. ''The Meaning of Conservatism'', London: The Macmillan Press, and Totowa, NJ: Barnes & Noble Books, 1980.</ref><ref name=Goss2006>Goss, Maxwell. [http://www.orthodoxytoday.org/articles6/ScrutonConservative.php "The Joy of Conservatism: An Interview with Roger Scruton"], ''New Pantagruel'' (courtesy of orthodoxytoday.org), January 2006.</ref> and later by his editorship of the conservative ''Salisbury Review''.<ref>''Gentle Regrets'', 51; Scruton and Dooley 2016, 46.</ref> He told ''The Guardian'' that his colleagues at Birkbeck vilified him over the book.<ref name=Edemariam/> The Marxist philosopher [[Gerald Cohen|Jerry Cohen]] of [[University College London]] reportedly refused to teach a seminar with Scruton, although they later became friends.<ref name=SDp46>Scruton and Dooley 2016, 46.</ref> He continued teaching at Birkbeck until 1992, first as a lecturer, by 1980 as [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]], and then as professor of aesthetics.<ref>Scruton and Dooley 2016, 39.</ref>

===''The Salisbury Review''===
[[File:Roger Scruton (2015), Prague.jpg|thumb|Scruton in Prague, 2015]]
In 1982 Scruton became founding editor of ''[[The Salisbury Review]]'', a journal championing traditional conservatism in opposition to [[Thatcherism]], which he edited until 2001.<ref name=ScrutonSept212002/><ref>Scruton, Roger. ''Conservative Thoughts: Essays from the Salisbury Review'', London: The Claridge Press, 1988.</ref> The ''Review'' was set up by a group of Tories known as the Salisbury Group—founded in 1978 by Diana Spearman and [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 6th Marquess of Salisbury|Robert Gascoyne-Cecil]]<ref>Cowling 1990, [https://books.google.com/books?id=k_RjyJSr_z0C&pg=PR29 xxix].</ref>—with the involvement of the [[Peterhouse school of history|Peterhouse Right]]. The latter were conservatives associated with the Cambridge college, including [[Maurice Cowling]], [[David Watkin (historian)|David Watkin]] and the mathematician Adrian Mathias.<ref name=Wroe/><ref>For the Peterhouse Right (he calls it the Peterhouse Group) and ''The Salisbury Review'', see Haseler, Stephen. ''The battle for Britain: Thatcher and the New Liberals'', London: I.B. Tauris, 1989, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_vPwkkJUA6IC&pg=PA138 138]; ''Gentle Regrets'', 51.</ref>

Scruton wrote that editing ''The Salisbury Review'' effectively ended his academic career in the United Kingdom. The magazine sought to provide an intellectual basis for conservatism, and was highly critical of key issues of the period, including the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, egalitarianism, feminism, foreign aid, multiculturalism and modernism. To begin with, Scruton had to write most of the articles himself, using pseudonyms: "I had to make it look as though there was something there in order that  ''there should be something there!''"<ref>Scruton and Dooley 2016, 47.</ref> He believes that the ''Review'' "helped a new generation of conservative intellectuals to emerge. At last it was possible to be a conservative and also to the ''left'' of something, to say 'Of course, the ''Salisbury Review'' is beyond the pale; but&nbsp;...'"<ref name=Gentlep59>''Gentle Regrets'', 59.</ref>

In 1984 the ''Review'' published a controversial article by [[Ray Honeyford]], a headmaster in Bradford, questioning the benefits of multicultural education.<ref>Honeyford, Ray. [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3654888/Education-and-Race-an-Alternative-View.html "Education and Race—an Alternative View"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 27 August 2006 (reprint of Honeyford's 1984 article).</ref><ref>Scruton, Roger.

Barcombe: Falmer Press, 1988.</ref> The [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] accused the ''Review'' of [[scientific racism]], and the [[University of Glasgow]] philosophy department boycotted a talk Scruton had been invited to deliver to its philosophy society. Scruton believed that the incidents made his position as a university professor untenable, although he also maintained that "it was worth sacrificing your chances of becoming a fellow of the [[British Academy]], a vice-chancellor or an emeritus professor for the sheer relief of uttering the truth".<ref name=ScrutonSept212002/><ref>''Gentle Regrets'', 77.</ref> (Scruton was in fact elected a [[fellow of the British Academy]] in 2008).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/fellowship/elections/2008/index.cfm |title=Elections to the Fellowship 2008 – British Academy |publisher=britac.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=17 June 2012}}</ref> In 2002 he described the effect of the editorship on his life:

<blockquote> It cost me many thousand hours of unpaid labour, a hideous character assassination in ''[[Private Eye]]'', three lawsuits, two interrogations, one expulsion, the loss of a university career in Britain, unendingly contemptuous reviews, Tory suspicion, and the hatred of decent liberals everywhere. And it was worth it.<ref name=ScrutonSept212002>Scruton, Roger.

===Writing===
The 1980s established Scruton as a prolific writer. Thirteen of his non-fiction works appeared between 1980 and 1989, as did first novel, ''Fortnight's Anger'' (1981). The most contentious publication was ''[[Thinkers of the New Left]]'' (1985), a collection of his essays from ''The Salisbury Review'', which criticized 14 prominent intellectuals, including [[E. P. Thompson]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].{{efn|The subjects of ''[[Thinkers of the New Left]]'' are [[E. P. Thompson]], [[Ronald Dworkin]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[R. D. Laing]], [[Raymond Williams]], [[Rudolf Bahro]], [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Louis Althusser]], [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Perry Anderson]], [[György Lukács]], [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].}} According to ''The Guardian'', the book was [[Remaindered book|remaindered]] after being greeted with "derision and outrage". Scruton said he became very depressed by the criticism.<ref name=Adams2015>Adams, Tim. [https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/oct/04/roger-scruton-my-father-looked-like-jeremy-corbyn-fools-frauds-firebrands-interview "Roger Scruton: 'Funnily enough, my father looked very like Jeremy Corbyn'"], ''The Guardian'', 4 October 2015.</ref> In 1987 he founded his own publisher, The Claridge Press, which he sold to the [[Continuum International Publishing Group]] in 2002.<ref>"The Claridge Press and Continuum", ''The Salisbury Review'', 21–22, 2002, 56: "The Continuum International Publishing Group is delighted to announce the acquisition of the small, independent publishing house Claridge Press from its proprietor, the philosopher, Professor Roger Scruton."</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090709070236/http://www.aei.org/scholar/100052 "Roger Scruton"], American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, 9 July 2009.</ref>

From 1983 to 1986 he wrote a weekly column for ''The Times''. Topics included music, wine and motorbike repair, but others were contentious. The features editor, [[Peter Stothard]], said that no one he had ever commissioned had "provoked more rage". Scruton made fun of anti-racism and the peace movement, and his support for [[Margaret Thatcher]] while she was prime minister was regarded, he wrote, as an "act of betrayal for a university teacher". His first column, "The Virtue of Irrelevance", argued that universities were destroying education "by making it relevant": "Replace pure by applied mathematics, logic by computer programming, architecture by engineering, history by sociology: the result will be a new generation of well-informed philistines, whose charmlessness will undo every advantage which their learning might otherwise have conferred."<ref name=ScrutonDooley2016p50>Scruton and Dooley 2016, 50–52.</ref><ref>Stothard, Peter.

===Activism in Eastern Europe===
[[File:Roger Scruton, Budapest, September 2016 (2).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.85|Scruton on "Europe and the Conservative Cause", Budapest, September 2016]]
From 1979 to 1989, Scruton was an active supporter of [[dissident]]s in [[Czechoslovakia]] under [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|Communist Party]] rule, forging links between the country's dissident academics and their counterparts in Western universities. As part of the [[Jan Hus Educational Foundation]], he and other academics visited [[Prague]] and [[Brno]], now in the [[Czech Republic]], in support of an underground education network started by the Czech dissident [[Julius Tomin]], smuggling in books, organizing lectures, and eventually arranging for students to study for a Cambridge external degree in theology (the only faculty that responded to the request for help). There were structured courses, ''[[samizdat]]'' translations, books were printed, and people sat exams in a cellar with papers smuggled out through the diplomatic bag.<ref>Vaughan, David.

Scruton was detained in 1985 in Brno before being expelled from the country. The Czech dissident [[:cs:Bronislava Müllerová|Bronislava Müllerová]] watched him walk across the border with Austria: "There was this broad empty space between the two border posts, absolutely empty, not a single human being in sight except for one soldier, and across that broad empty space trudged an English philosopher, Roger Scruton, with his little bag into Austria."<ref>Day 1999, 255.</ref> On 17 June that year, he was placed on the Index of Undesirable Persons. He writes that he was also followed during visits to Poland and Hungary.<ref name=Day1999p281/>

For his work in supporting dissidents, Scruton was awarded the First of June Prize in 1993 by the Czech city of [[Plzeň]], and in 1998 he was awarded the Czech Republic's [[Medal of Merit (Czech Republic)|Medal of Merit]] (First Class) by President [[Václav Havel]].<ref name=Day1999p281>Day 1999, 281–282; ''Gentle Regrets'', 142.</ref> Scruton has been strongly critical of figures in the West—in particular [[Eric Hobsbawm]]—who "chose to exonerate" former communist regimes' crimes and atrocities.<ref>Scruton, Roger.

===Tobacco company funding===
Scruton was criticized in 2002 for having written articles about [[smoking]] without disclosing that he was receiving a regular fee from [[Japan Tobacco International]] (JTI) (formerly [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company|R. J. Reynolds]]).<ref name=Gilmore2004/> In 1999 he and his wife—as part of their consultancy work for Horshells Farm Enterprises<ref name=companyinterests/><ref name=Scruton28Jan2002/>—began producing a quarterly briefing paper, ''The Risk of Freedom Briefing'' (1999–2007), about the state's control of risk.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20081120114207/http://www.riskoffreedom.com/archive.php ''The Risk of Freedom Briefing''], 2000–2006, accessed 11 September 2010.</ref> Distributed to journalists, the paper included discussions about drugs, alcohol and tobacco, and was sponsored by JTI.<ref name=Scruton28Jan2002/><ref name=ScrutonDooley2016p141>Scruton and Dooley 2016, 140–143.</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Scruton |first=Roger |date= 16 February 2002|title=Smoke Without Fire |url=http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/16th-february-2002/24/smoke-without-fire |journal=The Spectator}}</ref> Scruton wrote several articles in defence of smoking around this time, including one for ''The Times'',<ref>Scruton, Roger.

''The Guardian'' reported in 2002 that Scruton had been writing about these issues while failing to disclose that he was receiving £54,000 a year from JTI.<ref name=Gilmore2004/> The payments came to light when a September 2001 email from the Scrutons to JTI was leaked to ''The Guardian''. Signed by Scruton's wife, it asked the company to increase their £4,500 monthly fee to £5,500, in exchange for which Scruton would "aim to place an article every two months" in ''The Wall Street Journal'', ''Times'', ''Telegraph'', ''Spectator'', ''Financial Times'', ''Economist'', ''Independent'' or ''New Statesman''.<ref name=Maguire24Jan2002>Maguire, Kevin and Borger, Julian.

===Move to the United States===
[[File:Montpelier near Sperryville, closeup of house (cropped).JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.3|The Scrutons owned [[Montpelier (Sperryville, Virginia)|Montpelier]], near [[Sperryville, Virginia|Sperryville]], Virginia, from 2004 to 2009.<ref name=ScrutonDooley2016p192/>]]
The tobacco controversy damaged Scruton's consultancy business in England. In part because of that, and because the [[Hunting Act 2004]] had banned fox hunting in England and Wales, the Scrutons considered moving to the United States permanently, and in 2004 they purchased [[Montpelier (Sperryville, Virginia)|Montpelier]], an 18th-century [[Plantation complexes in the Southern United States|plantation house]] near [[Sperryville, Virginia]].<ref>Scruton and Dooley 2016, 181, 192–193.</ref> Scruton set up a company, Montpelier Strategy LLC, to promote the house as a venue for weddings and similar.<ref name=companyinterests/> The couple lived there while retaining Sunday Hill Farm, but decided in 2009 against a permanent move to the United States and sold the house.<ref name=ScrutonDooley2016p192>Scruton and Dooley 2016, 192–193; [https://web.archive.org/web/20110207060237/http://web.mac.com/rogerandsophie/iWeb/Site/Welcome.html "Welcome to Montpelier in Rappahannock County, Virginia"], web.mac.com/rogerandsophie.</ref>

Scruton held several part-time academic positions during this period. From 2005 to 2009 he was research professor at the [[Institute for the Psychological Sciences]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]], a graduate school of [[Divine Mercy University]], and in 2009 he worked at the [[American Enterprise Institute]] in Washington, D.C., where he wrote his book ''Green Philosophy'' (2011).<ref>Scruton and Dooley 2016, 183.</ref>

===Wine, opera===
From 2001 to 2009 Scruton wrote a wine column for the ''[[New Statesman]]'', and made contributions to ''[[The World of Fine Wine]]'' and ''Questions of Taste: The Philosophy of Wine'' (2007), with his essay "The Philosophy of Wine". His book ''I Drink Therefore I am: A Philosopher's Guide to Wine'' (2009) in part comprises material from his ''New Statesman'' column.<ref>{{cite news |author=Anthony Quinn |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/dec/20/drink-therefore-am-roger-scruton |title=I Drink Therefore I Am by Roger Scruton |work=The Guardian |date=20 December 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/writers/roger_scruton |title=Roger Scruton |publisher=New Statesman |date= |accessdate=9 August 2011}}</ref>

Scruton has also written three [[Libretto|libretti]], two set to music. The first is a one-act chamber, ''The Minister'',<ref>Scruton, Roger. [http://hdl.handle.net/2144/14498 "The Minister. A one-act opera in six scenes"], OpenBU, Boston University Libraries.</ref> and the second a two-act opera, ''[[Violet (opera)|Violet]]''. The latter, based on the life of the British harpsichordist [[Violet Gordon-Woodhouse]], was performed twice at the [[Guildhall School of Music]] in London in 2005.<ref name=about/>

==2010s: Academic posts, knighthood==
The Scrutons returned from the United States to make their home again at Sunday Hill Farm in Wiltshire. Scruton took an unpaid research professorship at [[Buckingham University]],<ref name=about/> and in 2010 was awarded an unpaid visiting professorship at the [[University of Oxford]] to teach graduate classes on aesthetics.<ref>[http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/news__events/older_news/-_title_of_visiting_professor_conferred_on_roger_scruton "Title of Visiting Professor conferred on Roger Scruton"], Philosophy Faculty, University of Oxford, accessed 27 December 2010.</ref> He is a senior research fellow at [[Blackfriars, Oxford|Blackfriars Hall]], Oxford.<ref>[http://www.bfriars.ox.ac.uk/hall/academic-staff/ "Academic staff"], Blackfriars.</ref> In 2010 he delivered the Scottish [[Gifford Lectures]] at the [[University of St Andrews]] on "The Face of God",<ref>[http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/gifford/2010/the-face-of-god/ "The Face of God"], University of St Andrews Gifford Lectures, 25 March 2010.</ref> and the following year he took up a quarter-time professorial fellowship at St Andrews in moral philosophy.<ref>[http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/philosophy/news/?newsid=130 "Roger Scruton appointed as quarter-time professorial fellow"], School of Philosophical, Anthropological and Film Studies, University of St Andrews, accessed 27 December 2010.</ref>

Two novels appeared during this period: ''[[Notes from Underground (Scruton novel)|Notes from Underground]]'' (2014) is based on his experiences in Czechoslovakia and ''[[The Disappeared (novel)|The Disappeared]]'' (2015) deals with child trafficking in a Yorkshire town.<ref>For the latter, Murray, Douglas.

== Philosophical and political views ==
===Aesthetics===
Scruton has specialised in [[aesthetics]] throughout his career. From 1971 to 1992 he taught aesthetics at Birkbeck College. His PhD thesis formed the basis of his first book, ''Art and Imagination'' (1974), in which he argued that "what demarcates aesthetic interest from other sorts is that it involves the appreciation of something for its own sake".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.british-aesthetics.org/91A877BE-2CEB-45A2-AD91-7FAD66D720F5/ForceRequestingFullContent/91A877BE-2CEB-45A2-AD91-7FAD66D720F5/uploads/Cain%20TODD.pdf |title=Imagination, Attitude and Experience in Aesthetic Judgement |first=Cain|last=Samuel Todd|work=Postgraduate Journal of Aesthetics|date=April 2004}}</ref>

Since then Scruton has published ''The Aesthetics of Architecture'' (1979), ''The Aesthetic Understanding'' (1983 and 1997), ''The Aesthetics of Music'' (1997), and ''Beauty'' (2010). In 2008 a two-day conference was held at [[Durham University]] to assess his impact in the field, and in 2012 a collection of essays, ''Scruton's Aesthetics'', was published by Palgrave Macmillan.<ref>[http://www.dur.ac.uk/philosophy/events/conferences/scrutonaesthetics/ "Scruton's Aesthetics"], Department of Philosophy, Durham University, 6 November 2012; Hamilton, Andy; Zangwill, Nick. ''Scruton's Aesthetics'', London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2012.</ref>

In an [[Intelligence Squared]] debate in March 2009, Scruton (seconding historian [[David Starkey]]) proposed the motion: "Britain has become indifferent to beauty" by holding an image of [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]]'s ''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|The Birth of Venus]]'' next to one of the supermodel [[Kate Moss]].<ref>Bayley, Stephen. [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/mar/22/national-trust-intelligence-squad "Has Britain become indifferent to beauty?], ''The Guardian'', 22 March 2009.</ref> Later that year Scruton wrote and presented a [[BBC Two]] documentary, ''[[Why Beauty Matters]]'', in which he argued that beauty should be restored to its traditional position in art, architecture and music.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00p6tsd |title=Why Beauty Matters |publisher=BBC |date=28 November 2009}}</ref> He wrote that he had received "more than 500 e-mails from viewers, all but one saying, 'Thank Heavens someone is saying what needs to be said'".<ref>{{cite web |last=Scruton |first=Roger |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519110549/http://spectator.org/archives/2010/05/17/on-defending-beauty |title=On Defending Beauty |work=The American Spectator |date=May 2010}}</ref>

===Arguments for conservatism===
{{Conservatism sidebar}}
Scruton is best known for his writing in support of conservatism.<ref>Freeman, Samuel. [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/04/21/enemies-of-roger-scruton/ "The Enemies of Roger Scruton"], ''New York Review of Books'', 21 April 2016.</ref> His second book, ''The Meaning of Conservatism'' (1980)—which he called "a somewhat [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegelian]] defence of Tory values in the face of their betrayal by the free marketeers"<ref name=Scruton2005p51>''Gentle Regrets'', 51.</ref>—was responsible, he said, for blighting his academic career.<ref name=Edemariam/><ref>Norman, Jesse. [http://www.spectator.co.uk/2014/09/how-to-be-a-conservative-by-roger-scruton-book-review/ "Passion, authority and the odd mini-rant: Scruton’s conservative vision"], ''The Spectator'', 27 September 2014.</ref>

He wrote in ''Gentle Regrets'' (2005) that he found several of [[Edmund Burke]]'s arguments in ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790) persuasive. Although Burke was writing about revolution, not socialism, Scruton was persuaded that, as he put it, the utopian promises of socialism are accompanied by an abstract vision of the mind that bears little relation to the way most people think. Burke also convinced him that there is no direction to history, no moral or spiritual progress; that people think collectively toward a common goal only during crises such as war, and that trying to organize society this way requires a real or imagined enemy; hence, Scruton wrote, the strident tone of socialist literature.<ref name=Regretsp40/>

Scruton further argued, following Burke, that society is held together by authority and the [[rule of law]], in the sense of the right to obedience, not by the imagined rights of citizens. Obedience, he wrote, is "the prime virtue of political beings, the disposition that makes it possible to govern them, and without which societies crumble into 'the dust and powder of individuality'". Real freedom, Scruton wrote, does not stand in conflict with obedience, but is its other side.<ref name=Regretsp40>''Gentle Regrets'', 40–41.</ref> He was also persuaded by Burke's arguments about the [[social contract]], including that most parties to the contract are either dead or not yet born. To forget this, he wrote—to throw away customs and institutions—is to "place the present members of society in a dictatorial dominance over those who went before, and those who came after them".<ref>''Gentle Regrets'', 43.</ref>

Scruton argued that beliefs that appear to be examples of prejudice may be useful and important: "our most necessary beliefs may be both unjustified and unjustifiable, from our own perspective, and the attempt to justify them will merely lead to their loss." A prejudice in favour of [[modesty]] in women and [[chivalry]] in men, for example, may aid the stability of sexual relationships and the raising of children, although these are not offered as reasons in support of the prejudice. It may therefore be easy to show the prejudice as irrational, but there will be a loss nonetheless if it is discarded.<ref>''Gentle Regrets'', 42.</ref> Scruton has been critical of the contemporary [[Feminism|feminist]] movement, while reserving praise for suffragists such as [[Mary Wollstonecraft]].<ref name=Edemariam/>

[[File:Nexus Masterclass Roger Scruton, November 2015.webm|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Scruton discussing the [[European Union]] and the [[nation state]], November 2015]]
In ''Arguments for Conservatism'' (2006), he marked out the areas in which philosophical thinking is required if conservatism is to be intellectually persuasive. He argued that human beings are creatures of limited and local affections. Territorial loyalty is at the root of all forms of government where law and liberty reign supreme; every expansion of jurisdiction beyond the frontiers of the nation state leads to a decline in accountability.<ref>Scruton, Roger. ''A Political Philosophy: Arguments for Conservatism'', London: Bloomsbury, 2006, 3, 19.</ref>

He opposed elevating the "nation" above its people, which would threaten rather than facilitate citizenship and peace. "Conservatism and conservation" are two aspects of a single policy, that of husbanding resources, including the [[social capital]] embodied in laws, customs and institutions, and the material capital contained in the environment. He argued further that the law should not be used as a weapon to advance special interests. People impatient for reform—for example in the areas of [[euthanasia]] or [[abortion]]—are reluctant to accept what may be "glaringly obvious to others—that the law exists precisely to impede their ambitions".<ref>''Arguments for Conservatism'', 15, 34, 69.</ref>

He defined [[post-modernism]] as the claim that there are no grounds for truth, objectivity, and meaning, and therefore conflicts between views are nothing more than contests of power, and argued that, while the West is required to judge other cultures in their own terms, Western culture is adversely judged as ethnocentric and racist. He wrote: "The very reasoning which sets out to destroy the ideas of objective truth and absolute value imposes political correctness as absolutely binding, and cultural relativism as objectively true."<ref>''Arguments for Conservatism'', 106, 115, 117.</ref>

===Religion and totalitarianism===
Scruton contends, following [[Immanuel Kant]], that human beings have a transcendental dimension, a sacred core exhibited in their capacity for [[self-reflection]].<ref>Dooley, Mark. ''Roger Scruton: The Philosopher on Dover Beach''. Continuum, 2009, 12, 42.</ref> He argues that we are in an era of secularization without precedent in the history of the world; writers and artists such as [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Arnold Schoenberg]] "devoted much energy to recuperating the experience of the sacred—but as a private rather than a public form of consciousness." Because these thinkers directed their art at the few, he writes, it has never appealed to the many.<ref name=Arguments142>''Arguments for Conservatism'', 142–143, 146–147, 150–153.</ref>

He defines totalitarianism as the absence of any constraint on central authority, with every aspect of life the concern of government. Advocates of totalitarianism feed on resentment, Scruton argues, and having seized power they proceed to abolish institutions—such as the law, property, and religion—that create authorities. Scruton writes, "To the resentful it is these institutions that are the cause of inequality, and therefore the cause of their humiliations and failures." He argues that revolutions are not conducted from below by the people, but from above, in the name of the people, by an aspiring elite.<ref name=Arguments142/>

Scruton suggests that the importance of [[Newspeak]] in totalitarian societies is that the power of language to describe reality is replaced by language whose purpose is to avoid encounters with realities. He agrees with {{ill|Alain Besançon|WD=Q2629540}} that the totalitarian society envisaged by [[George Orwell]] in ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' (1949) can be only understood in theological terms, as a society founded on a transcendental negation. In accordance with T. S. Eliot, Scruton believes that true originality is only possible within a tradition, and that it is precisely in modern conditions—conditions of fragmentation, heresy, and unbelief—that the conservative project acquires its sense.<ref>''Arguments for Conservatism'', 162–163, 182, 194.</ref>

Scruton considers that religion plays a basic function in "endarkening" human minds. "Endarkenment" is Scruton's way of describing the process of socialization through which certain behaviours and choices are closed off and forbidden to the subject, which he considers necessary to curb socially damaging impulses and behaviour.<ref>Ireland, P. "Endarkening the mind: Roger Scruton and the power of law", ''Social & Legal Studies'', 6(1), 1997, 51.</ref><ref name=Stafford1991/>

===Sex===
{{undue weight|section|date=February 2017}}
[[Jonathan Dollimore]] wrote that Scruton's ''[[Sexual Desire (book)|Sexual Desire]]'' (1986) based a conservative sexual ethic on the Hegelian proposition that "the final end of every rational being is the building of the self", which involves recognizing the other as an end in itself. Scruton argues that the major feature of perversion is "sexual release that avoids or abolishes the ''other''", which he sees as [[narcissistic]] and [[solipsistic]].<ref name=Dollimore260>[[Dollimore, Jonathan]]. ''Sexual Dissidence: Augustine to Wilde, Freud to Foucault''. Oxford University Press, 1991, 260–261.</ref> [[Martha Nussbaum]] argued that Scruton did not apply his principle of otherness equally—for example, to sexual relationships between adults and children.<ref>Nussbaum, Martha. [https://newrepublic.com/article/69203/the-passion-fashion "The Passion Fashion"], ''The New Republic'', 10 September 2009.</ref> He argued in an essay, "Sexual morality and the liberal consensus" (1989), that [[homosexuality]] is a perversion because the body of the homosexual's lover belongs to the same category as his own.<ref>Scruton, Roger. ''The Philosopher on Dover Beach''. Carcanet Press Limited, 1990, 268.</ref>

Scruton argued further that gays have no children and consequently no interest in creating a socially stable future. He therefore considered it justified to "instil in our children feelings of revulsion" towards homosexuality,<ref name=Stafford1991>Stafford, J. Martin. [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00372432 "The two minds of Roger Scruton"], ''Studies in Philosophy and Education'', 11(2), 1991, 187–193. {{doi|10.1007/BF00372432}}</ref> and in 2007 he challenged the idea that gays should have the right to adopt.<ref>Scruton, Roger. [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3636798/This-right-for-gays-is-an-injustice-to-children.html "This 'right' for gays is an injustice to children"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 28 January 2007.</ref> Scruton told ''The Guardian'' in 2010 that he would no longer defend the view that revulsion against homosexuality can be justified.<ref name=Edemariam>Edemariam, Aida. [https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/jun/05/roger-scruton-interview "Roger Scruton: A pessimist's guide to life"], ''The Guardian'', 5 June 2010.</ref>

===English Independence===
Roger Scruton also supports [[English Independence]] because he believes that it would uphold friendship between [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]]; [[Northern Ireland]]. Scruton also supports English Independence as he thinks it means the English will have a say in all matters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26173128|title= A Point of View: Should the English have a say on Scottish independence?|date= 23 February 2014|publisher= [[BBC]]|access-date= 30 August 2017|quote= I would vote for English independence, as a step towards strengthening the friendship between our countries.}}</ref>
