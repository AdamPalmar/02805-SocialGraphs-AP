'''Jacques Rancière''' ({{IPA-fr|ʁɑ̃sjɛʁ|lang}}; born 1940) is a [[France|French]] [[philosopher]], Professor of Philosophy at [[European Graduate School]] in [[Saas-Fee]]  and Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Paris VIII: Vincennes—Saint-Denis]] who came to prominence when he co-authored ''[[Reading Capital]]'' (1968), with the [[Structural Marxism|structuralist Marxist]] philosopher [[Louis Althusser]].<ref>See: [http://www.egs.edu/faculty/jacques-ranciere/biography/ Jacques Rancière Faculty Profile] at [[European Graduate School]]</ref>

==Life and work==
Rancière contributed to the influential volume ''[[Reading Capital]]'' before publicly breaking with Althusser over his attitude toward the May 1968 [[French May|student uprising in Paris]]; Rancière felt Althusser's theoretical stance did not leave enough room for spontaneous popular uprising.<ref name="rancieredavis">Ben Davis. [http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/books/davis/davis8-17-06.asp Rancière, For Dummies.] The Politics of Aesthetics. Book Review.</ref>

Since then, Rancière has departed from the path set by his teacher and published a series of works probing the concepts that make up our understanding of political discourse, such as [[ideology]] and [[proletariat]]. He sought to address whether the working class in fact exists, and how the masses of workers that thinkers like Althusser referred to continuously enter into a relationship with [[knowledge]], particularly the limits of philosophers' knowledge with respect to the proletariat. An example of this line of thinking is Rancière's book entitled ''Le philosophe et ses pauvres'' (''The Philosopher and His Poor'', 1983), a book about the role of the poor in the intellectual lives of philosophers.

More recently Rancière has written on the topic of human rights and specifically the role of international human rights organizations in asserting the authority to determine which groups of people, again the problem of masses, justify [[human rights]] interventions and even war.

Rancière's book, ''[[The Ignorant Schoolmaster: Five Lessons in Intellectual Emancipation]]'' (original title ''Le Maître ignorant: Cinq leçons sur l'émancipation intellectuelle'', published in 1987) was written for educators and educators-to-be.  Through the story of [[Joseph Jacotot]], Rancière challenges his readers to consider equality as a starting point rather than a destination.  In doing so, he asks educators to abandon the themes and rhetoric of cultural deficiency and salvation. Rather than requiring informed schoolmasters to guide students towards prescribed and alienating ends, Rancière argues that educators can channel the equal intelligence in all to facilitate their intellectual growth in virtually unlimited directions. The schoolmaster need not know anything (and may be ignorant). Rancière begins with the premises that all are of equal intelligence and that any collective educational exercise founded on this principle can provide the insights from which knowledge is constructed. He claims that the poor and disenfranchised should feel perfectly able to teach ''themselves'' whatever it is they want to know. Furthermore, anyone can lead, and the oppressed should not feel bound to experts or reliant on others for their intellectual emancipation.

Jacotot advocated the 'equality of intelligence' and claimed that an ignorant person could teach another ignorant person. Rancière developed this idea in ''The Ignorant Schoolmaster'', saying that “there is stultification whenever one intelligence is subordinated to another ... whoever teaches without emancipating stultifies”.<ref>{{cite book|title=[[The Ignorant Schoolmaster: Five Lessons in Intellectual Emancipation]]|author=Jacques Ranciere |pages=13, 18|year=1981}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Epistemologies of Ignorance in Education |author=Molly Quinn |chapter=Committing (to) Ignorance |pages=31–52}}</ref>

==Influence==
In 2006, it was reported that Rancière's [[aesthetic]] theory had become a point of reference in the [[visual arts]], and Rancière has lectured at such art world events as the Frieze Art Fair.<ref name="rancieredavis"/> Former French presidential candidate [[Ségolène Royal]] described Rancière as her favourite philosopher.<ref>{{cite web|title=Translation: Jacques Rancière, the philosopher who inspires Ségolène Royal|url=http://www.ufppc.org/us-a-world-news-mainmenu-35/5508-translation-sl-royals-favorite-philosopher.html|work=United for Peace of Pierce County, WA|publisher=[[Paris Match]]|accessdate=9 December 2013|author=Patrice Bollon|author2=Mark K.
