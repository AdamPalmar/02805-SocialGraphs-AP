'''James Earl Baumgartner''' (March 23, 1943 – December 28, 2011) was an American [[mathematician]] who worked in [[set theory]], [[mathematical logic]] and foundations, and [[topology]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rand-wilson.com/obituaries/obit_view.php?id=26 |title=James E. Baumgartner Obituary |publisher=Rand-wilson.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-06}}</ref>

Baumgartner was born in [[Wichita, Kansas]], began his undergraduate study at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in 1960, then transferred to the [[University of California, Berkeley]], from which he received his PhD in 1970 from  for a dissertation entitled ''Results and Independence Proofs in Combinatorial Set Theory''. His advisor was [[Robert Vaught]].<ref>{{MathGenealogy|id=22587}}</ref>
He became a professor at [[Dartmouth College]] in 1969, and there spent his entire career.

One of Baumgartner's results is the consistency of the statement that any two <math>\aleph_1</math>-dense sets of reals are order isomorphic (a set of reals is <math>\aleph_1</math>-dense if it has exactly <math>\aleph_1</math> points in every open interval). With [[András Hajnal]] he proved the result ([[Baumgartner–Hajnal theorem]]) that the [[partition relation]] <math>\omega_1\to(\alpha)^2_n</math> holds for <math>\alpha<\omega_1,n<\omega</math>. He died of a heart attack in 2011.<ref>[http://rand-wilson.com/obituaries/obit_view.php?id=26]</ref>
