==Life==
Iris Murdoch was born in [[Phibsborough]], Dublin, Ireland, the daughter of Irene Alice ([[née]] Richardson 1899–1985)<ref name=Meyers>{{cite book|last1=Meyers|first1=Jeffrey|title=Remembering Iris Murdoch: Letters and Interviews|date=2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=9781137352415|accessdate=1 June 2015|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qtQl_UyY928C&pg=PT24}}</ref> and Wills John Hughes Murdoch. Her father, a [[civil service|civil servant]], came from a mainly [[Presbyterian]] sheep farming family from [[Hillhall]], [[County Down]]. In 1915, he enlisted as a soldier in [[King Edward's Horse]] and served in France during the [[World War I|First World War]] before being commissioned as a [[Second lieutenant]]. Her mother had trained as a singer before Iris was born, and was from a middle class [[Church of Ireland]] family in Dublin.

Murdoch was educated in progressive [[independent school]]s, entering the [[Ibstock Place School|Froebel Demonstration School]] in 1925 and attending [[Badminton School]] in Bristol as a boarder from 1932 to 1938. In 1938 she went up to [[Somerville College, Oxford]], with the intention of studying English, but switched to Classics. At Oxford she studied philosophy with [[Donald M. MacKinnon]] and attended [[Eduard Fraenkel]]'s seminars on [[Agamemnon (play)#Agamemnon|''Agamemnon'']].<ref name=Conradi2001/> She was awarded a [[First Class Honours]] degree in 1942.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/3591/Iris%20Murdoch.html | title = Iris Murdoch | accessdate = 27 June 2012 | author = Somerville College | work = Somerville Stories}}</ref> After leaving Oxford she went to work in London for [[HM Treasury]].  In June 1944 she left the Treasury and went to work for the [[UNRRA]]. At first she was stationed in London at the agency's European Regional Office. In 1945 she was transferred first to [[Brussels]], then to [[Innsbruck]], and finally to [[Graz]], Austria, where she worked in a refugee camp. She left the UNRRA in 1946.<ref name=Conradi2001/>{{rp|245}}

From 1947 to 1948 Iris Murdoch studied philosophy as a postgraduate at [[Newnham College, Cambridge]]. She met [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] at Cambridge but did not hear him lecture, as he had left his [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] professorship before she arrived.<ref name=Conradi2001 />{{rp|262–263}}<ref name="Oxford DNB">{{cite encyclopedia|last=Conradi|first=Peter J.|authorlink=Peter J.

In 1956 Murdoch married [[John Bayley (writer)|John Bayley]], a literary critic, novelist, and from 1974 to 1992 Warton Professor of English at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], whom she had met in Oxford in 1954. The unusual romantic partnership lasted more than forty years until Murdoch's death. Bayley thought that sex was "inescapably ridiculous."

Iris Murdoch's first novel, ''[[Under the Net]]'', was published in 1954. She had previously published essays on philosophy, and the first [[monograph]] about [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] published in English. She went on to produce 25 more novels and additional works of philosophy, as well as poetry and drama. In 1976 she was named to the Commander of [[Order of the British Empire]] and in 1987 was made a Dame Commander of Order of the British Empire.<ref name=Conradi2001 />{{rp|571, 575}} She was awarded [[honorary degree]]s by the [[University of Bath]] (DLitt,1983),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bath.ac.uk/ceremonies/hongrads/ |title=Honorary Graduates 1989 to present &#124; University of Bath |publisher=Bath.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=29 August 2013}}</ref> University of Cambridge (1993)<ref>[http://www.cam.ac.uk/univ/degrees/honorary/recipients.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130201183233/http://www.cam.ac.uk/univ/degrees/honorary/recipients.html |date=1 February 2013 }}</ref> and [[Kingston University]] (1994), among others.

==Work==

===Philosophy===
For some time, Murdoch's influence and achievements as a philosopher were eclipsed by her success as a novelist, but recent appraisals have increasingly accorded her a substantial role in postwar Anglo-American philosophy, particularly for her unfashionably prescient work in moral philosophy and her reinterpretation of Aristotle and Plato. [[Martha Nussbaum]] has argued for Murdoch's "transformative impact on the discipline" of moral philosophy because she directed her analysis not at the once-dominant matters of will and choice, but at those of attention (how people learn to see and conceive of one another) and phenomenal experience (how the sensory "thinginess" of life shapes moral sensibility).<ref name="NussbaumNR">{{cite journal|last1=Nussbaum|first1=Martha C.|authorlink1=Martha Nussbaum|title=When she was good|journal=New Republic|date=31 December 2001|volume=225|pages=28-34|accessdate=23 May 2017}}</ref> 

In a recent survey of Murdoch's philosophical work, Justin Broackes points to several distinctive features of Murdoch's moral philosophy, including a "[[moral realism]] or ‘naturalism’, allowing into the world cases of such properties as humility or generosity; an anti‐scientism; a rejection of [[David Hume|Humean]] moral psychology; a sort of ‘particularism’; special attention to the virtues; and emphasis on the metaphor of moral perception or ‘seeing’ moral facts."<ref name=Broakesabstract>{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-928990-5| last = Broackes| first = Justin.| title = Iris Murdoch, philosopher: a collection of essays| chapter = Introduction| location = Oxford, England| date = 2012|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199289905.001.0001/acprof-9780199289905}}</ref> Broackes also notes that Murdoch's influence on the discipline of philosophy was sometimes indirect, since it impacted both her contemporaries and the following generation of philosophers, particularly Elizabeth Anscombe, Philippa Foot, John McDowell, and Bernard Williams.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Broackes|first1=Justin|title="Introduction," Irish Murdoch, Philosopher|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199289905}}</ref>

Her philosophical work was influenced by [[Simone Weil]] (from whom she borrows the concept of 'attention'), and by [[Plato]], under whose banner she claimed to fight.<ref name=sovereignty>{{cite book | last = Murdoch | first = Iris | title = The Sovereignty of Good | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780415253994 }}</ref>{{rp|76}} In re-animating Plato, she gives force to the reality of the Good, and to a sense of the moral life as a pilgrimage from illusion to reality.  From this perspective, Murdoch's work offers perceptive criticism of Kant, [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] ('early' and 'late').  Her most central parable, which appears in ''[[The Sovereignty of Good]]'', asks us (in Nussbaum's succinct account), "to imagine a mother-in-law, M, who has contempt for D, her daughter-in-law. M sees D as common, cheap, low. Since M is a self-controlled Englishwoman, she behaves (so Murdoch stipulates) with perfect graciousness all the while, and no hint of her real view surfaces in her acts. But she realizes, too, that her feelings and thoughts are unworthy, and likely to be generated by jealousy and an excessively keen desire to hang on to her son. So she sets herself a moral task: she will change her view of D, making it more accurate, less marred by selfishness. She gives herself exercises in vision: where she is inclined to say 'coarse,' she will say, and see, 'spontaneous.' Where she is inclined to say 'common,' she will say, and see, 'fresh and naive.' As time goes on, the new images supplant the old. Eventually M does not have to make such an effort to control her actions: they flow naturally from the way she has come to see D."<ref name="NussbaumNR" /> This is how M cultivates a pattern of behavior that leads her to view D "justly or lovingly".<ref name=perfection>{{cite book | last1 = Murdoch | first1 = Iris | title = Existentialists and Mystics: Writings on Philosophy and Literature | chapter = The Idea of Perfection | editors = Peter Conradi (Ed) | publisher = Chatto & Windus | year = 1997 | location = London |isbn=0701166290}}</ref>{{rp|317}}  The parable is partly meant to show (against Oxford contemporaries including [[R. M. Hare]] and [[Stuart Hampshire]]) the importance of the 'inner' life to moral action.  Seeing another aright can depend on overcoming jealousy, and discoveries about the world involve inner work.

===Fiction===
Her novels, in their attention and generosity to the inner lives of individuals, follow the tradition of novelists like [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Dostoyevsky]], [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]], [[George Eliot]], and [[Marcel Proust|Proust]], besides showing an abiding love of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]].   There is however great variety in her achievement, and the richly layered structure and compelling realistic comic imagination of  ''[[The Black Prince (novel)|The Black Prince]]'' (1973) is very different from the early comic work ''[[Under the Net]]'' (1954) or ''[[The Unicorn (novel)|The Unicorn]]'' (1963). ''The Unicorn'' can be read as a sophisticated [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] [[Romance novel|romance]], or as a novel with Gothic trappings, or perhaps as a parody of the Gothic mode of writing. ''[[The Black Prince (novel)|The Black Prince]]'', for which Murdoch won the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]], is a study of [[Hypersexuality|erotic obsession]], and the text becomes more complicated, suggesting multiple interpretations, when subordinate characters contradict the narrator and the mysterious "editor" of the book in a series of afterwords. Though her novels differ markedly, and her style developed, themes recur.  Her novels often include upper-middle-class male intellectuals caught in moral dilemmas, gay characters, refugees, Anglo-Catholics with crises of faith, empathetic pets, curiously "knowing" children and sometimes a powerful and almost demonic male "enchanter" who imposes his will on the other characters—a type of man Murdoch is said to have modelled on her lover, the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] laureate [[Elias Canetti]].<ref name=Conradi2001/>{{rp|350–352}}

Murdoch was awarded the [[Man Booker Prize|Booker Prize]] in 1978 for ''[[The Sea, the Sea]]'', a finely detailed novel about the power of love and loss, featuring a retired stage director who is overwhelmed by jealousy when he meets his erstwhile lover after several decades apart.  An authorised collection of her poetic writings, ''Poems by Iris Murdoch'', appeared in 1997, edited by [[Paul Hullah]] and Yozo Muroya. Several of her works have been adapted for the screen, including the British television series of her novels ''[[An Unofficial Rose]]'' and ''[[The Bell (novel)|The Bell]]''. [[J. B. Priestley]]'s dramatisation of her 1961 novel ''[[A Severed Head]]'' starred [[Ian Holm]] and [[Richard Attenborough]].

In 1997, she was awarded the [[Golden PEN Award]] by [[English PEN]] for "a Lifetime's Distinguished Service to Literature".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.englishpen.org/prizes/golden-pen-award-for-a-lifetimes-distinguished-service-to-literature |title=Golden Pen Award, official website |publisher=[[English PEN]] |author= |date= |accessdate=3 December 2012}}</ref>

==Political views==
Iris Murdoch won a scholarship to study at [[Vassar College]] in 1946, but was refused a visa to enter the United States because she had joined the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] in 1938, while a student at Oxford. She left the party in 1942, when she went to work at the Treasury, but remained sympathetic to communism for several years.<ref name=Conradi2001/>{{rp|172}}<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Todd | first1 = Richard | title = Iris Murdoch | publisher = Methuen | year = 1984 | location = London | isbn = 0416354203 | quote = Here, like many other intellectuals in the 1930s, she became a member of the Communist Party; she later resigned in disillusion, but remained for a long time close to the Left.}}</ref>{{rp|15}} In later years she was allowed to visit the United States, but always had to obtain a waiver from the provisions of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952#Provisions|McCarran Act]], which barred Communist Party members and former members from entering the country.  In a 1990 [[Paris Review]] interview she said that her membership of the Communist Party had made her see "how strong and how awful it [Marxism] is, certainly in its organized form".<ref>{{cite journal | title = Iris Murdoch: The Art of Fiction No. 117 | journal = Paris Review | date = Summer 1990 | first = Jeffrey | last = Meyers | issue = 115 | pages = 206–224| id = | url = http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2313/the-art-of-fiction-no-117-iris-murdoch | accessdate = 20 June 2012 | quote = But it was just as well, in a way, to have seen the inside of Marxism because then one realizes how strong and how awful it is, certainly in its organized form.}}</ref>{{rp|210}}

Aside from her Communist Party membership, her Irish heritage is the other sensitive aspect of Murdoch's political life that seems to attract interest.  Part of the interest revolves around the fact that, although Irish by both birth and traced descent on both sides, Murdoch does not display the full set of political opinions that are sometimes assumed to go with this origin: "No one ever agrees about who is entitled to lay claim to Irishness.  Iris's Belfast cousins today call themselves British, not Irish... [but] with both parents brought up in Ireland, and an ancestry within Ireland both North and South going back three centuries, Iris has as valid a claim to call herself Irish as most North Americans have to call themselves American".<ref name=Conradi2001/>{{rp|24}}  Conradi notes A.N. Wilson's record that Murdoch regretted the sympathetic portrayal of the Irish nationalist cause she had given earlier in ''[[The Red and the Green]]'', and a competing defence of the book at [[Caen]] in 1978.<ref name=Conradi2001/>{{rp|465}} The novel while broad of sympathy is hardly an unambiguous celebration of the 1916 rising, dwelling upon bloodshed, unintended consequences and the evils of romanticism, besides celebrating selfless individuals on both sides. Later, of [[Ian Paisley]], Iris Murdoch stated "[he] sincerely condemns violence and did not intend to incite the Protestant terrorists. That he is emotional and angry is not surprising, after 12–15 years of murderous IRA activity. All this business is deep in my soul, I'm afraid."<ref name=Conradi2001/>{{rp|465}}  In private correspondence with her close friend and fellow philosopher [[Philippa Foot]], she remarked in 1978 that she felt "unsentimental about Ireland to the point of hatred"  and, of a Franco-Irish conference she had attended in Caen in 1982, said that "the sounds of all those Irish voices made me feel privately sick".<ref>{{cite news | first = Mark | last = Brown | title = Iris Murdoch Letters Reveal Love for Close Friend Philippa Foot | date = 31 August 2012 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/31/irish-murdoch-letters-philippa-foot?newsfeed=true | work = The Guardian | accessdate = 4 September 2012}}</ref>

==Biographies and memoirs==
[[Peter J. Conradi]]'s 2001 biography was the fruit of long research and authorised access to journals and other papers.  It is also a labour of love, and of a friendship with Murdoch that extended from a meeting at her [[Gifford Lectures]] to her death.  The book was well received. [[John Updike]] commented: "There would be no need to complain of [[Biography in literature|literary biographies]] [...] if they were all as good".<ref name=Updike>{{Cite news

He also recalled his personal encounters with Murdoch in ''Going Buddhist: Panic and Emptiness, the Buddha and Me''. (Short Books, 2005). Conradi's archive of material on Murdoch, together with Iris Murdoch's Oxford library, is held at [[Kingston University]].<ref>[http://fass.kingston.ac.uk/research/iris-murdoch/ Centre for Iris Murdoch Studies, Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences] Kingston University, Retrieved 9 April 2011.</ref>

An account of Murdoch's life with a different ambition is given by [[A. N. Wilson]] in his 2003 book ''Iris Murdoch as I Knew Her''. The work was described by [[Galen Strawson]] in ''[[The Guardian]]'' as "mischievously revelatory" and labelled by Wilson himself as an "anti-biography".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/biography/0,6121,1036391,00.html|title=Telling Tales|publisher=The Guardian|last=Strawson|first=Galen|date=6 September 2003|accessdate=19 June 2012}}</ref> Wilson eschews objectivity, but is careful to stress his affection for his subject. Wilson remarks that Murdoch "had clearly been one of those delightful young women... who was prepared to go to bed with almost anyone".<ref name=Wilson/>{{rp|59}}   While Murdoch's thought is an inspiration for Conradi, Wilson treats Murdoch's philosophical work as at best a distraction.  In a [[BBC Radio 4]] discussion of Murdoch and her work in 2009, Wilson stated his opinion, with which he acknowledged that "no doctor would agree", that Murdoch's struggle to complete her late philosophical book, ''Metaphysics as a Guide to Morals'', reduced her to despair and precipitated her into Alzheimer's.<ref>{{Cite web| publisher = BBC Radio 4| title = An Unofficial Iris| accessdate = 30 August 2015| date = 27 June 2009| time = 48:00| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00l953t}}</ref>

John Bayley wrote two memoirs of his life with Iris Murdoch. ''Iris: A Memoir'' was published in the United Kingdom in 1998, shortly before her death. The American edition, which was published in 1999, was called ''[[Elegy for Iris]]''. A sequel entitled ''Iris and Her Friends'' was published in 1999, after her death. Murdoch was portrayed by [[Kate Winslet]] and [[Judi Dench]] in [[Richard Eyre]]'s film ''[[Iris (2001 film)|Iris]]'' (2001), based on Bayley's memories of his wife as she developed Alzheimer's disease.<ref>{{Cite news| last = Schudel| first = Matt| title = John Bayley, who stirred controversy with his intimate memoir of his wife, dies at 89| work = [[The Washington Post]]| accessdate = 20 February 2015| date = 21 January 2015| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/john-bayley-who-stirred-controvery-with-his-intimate-memoir-of-his-wife-dies-at-89/2015/01/21/91e29c8e-a19c-11e4-b146-577832eafcb4_story.html}}</ref>
