'''Herbert Kenneth Kunen''' (born August 2, 1943) is an emeritus professor of [[mathematics]] at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]<ref>http://www.math.wisc.edu/~apache/emeriti.html</ref> who works in [[set theory]] and its applications to various areas of mathematics, such as set-theoretic [[topology]] and [[measure theory]]. He also works on [[associativity|non-associative]] algebraic systems, such as [[quasigroup|loops]], and uses computer software, such as the [[Otter theorem prover]], to derive theorems in these areas.

Kunen showed that if there exists a nontrivial elementary embedding ''j'':''L''→''L'' of the [[constructible universe]], then [[zero sharp|0<sup>#</sup>]] exists.
He proved the consistency of a normal, <math>\aleph_2</math>-saturated ideal on <math>\aleph_1</math> from the consistency of the existence of a [[huge cardinal]]. He introduced the method of iterated [[ultrapower]]s, with which he proved that if <math>\kappa</math> is a [[measurable cardinal]] with <math>2^\kappa>\kappa^+</math> or <math>\kappa</math> is a [[strongly compact cardinal]] then there is an [[inner model]] of set theory with <math>\kappa</math> many measurable cardinals. He proved [[Kunen's inconsistency theorem]] showing the impossibility of a nontrivial elementary embedding <math>V\to  V</math>, which had been suggested as a [[large cardinal]] assumption (a [[Reinhardt cardinal]]).

Away from the area of large cardinals, Kunen is known for intricate forcing and combinatorial constructions. He proved that it is consistent that the Martin Axiom first fails at a singular cardinal and constructed 
under CH a compact L-space supporting a nonseparable measure. He also showed that <math>P(\omega)/Fin</math> has no increasing chain of length <math>\omega_2 </math> in the standard Cohen model
where the continuum is <math>\aleph_2</math>. The concept of a [[Jech–Kunen tree]] is named after him and [[Thomas Jech]].

Kunen completed his undergraduate degree at Caltech<ref name="TopologySpecialIssue" /> and received his [[Ph.D.]] in 1968 from [[Stanford University]],<ref>{{MathGenealogy|id=9055}}</ref> where he was supervised by [[Dana Scott]].
