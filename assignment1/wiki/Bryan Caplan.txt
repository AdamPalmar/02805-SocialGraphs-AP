===''The Myth of the Rational Voter''===
''[[The Myth of the Rational Voter]]: Why Democracies Choose Bad Policies'', published 
in 2007, further develops the "rational irrationality" concept from Caplan's earlier academic writing. It draws heavily from the ''Survey of Americans and Economists on the Economy'' in making the argument that voters have systematically biased beliefs about many important economic topics. Caplan writes that [[rational irrationality]] is an explanation for the failure of democracy.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Block|first1=Walter|title=Review of "The Myth of the Rational Voter"|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/defending-the-undefendable/201112/review-the-myth-the-rational-voter|accessdate=29 September 2016|work=Psychology Today|publisher=Sussex|date=Dec 25, 2011|ref=PsychToday}}</ref> The book was reviewed in the popular press, including the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'',<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118401997995161399|title = Casting a Ballot With A Certain Cast of Mind|last = Casse|first = Daniel|date = 2007-07-10|accessdate = 2013-09-29|publisher = ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''}}</ref> the ''[[New York Times]]'',<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/27/magazine/27wwln-idealab-t.html?_r=0|title = Clueless|last = Bass|first = Gary J.|date = 2007-05-27|publisher = ''[[New York Times]]''|accessdate = 2013-09-29}}</ref> and the ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2007/07/09/070709crbo_books_menand|title = Fractured Franchise: Are the wrong people voting?|last = Menand|first = Louis|date = 2007-07-09|publisher = ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]''|accessdate = 2013-09-29}}</ref> as well as in academic publications such as the ''[[Journal of Libertarian Studies]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/journals/jls/22_1/22_1_35.pdf|title = ''The Myth of the Rational Voter'' (book review)|last = Block|first = Walter|publisher = ''[[Journal of Libertarian Studies]]'', Vol. 22 (2011), Page 689-718|accessdate = 2013-09-29}}</ref> ''[[Public Choice]]'',<ref name=LomaskyReview>{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/k6396012k8647800/|title = Swing and a myth: a review of Caplan’s ''The Myth of the Rational Voter''|last = Lomasky|first = Loren|date = June 2008|accessdate = 2013-09-29|doi=10.1007/s11127-007-9273-7|volume=135|issue=3-4|journal=Public Choice|pages=469–484}}</ref> ''[[Libertarian Papers]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://libertarianpapers.org/articles/2010/lp-2-28.pdf|title = Critique of Caplan's ''The Myth of the Rational Voter''|last = Farrand|first = Stuart|year = 2010|publisher = ''[[Libertarian Papers]]'', Vol. 2, Article No. 28|accessdate = 2013-09-29}}</ref> and ''[[The Independent Review]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?a=723|title = The Myth of the Rational Voter: Why Democracies Choose Bad Policies (book review)|last = Callahan|first = Gene|date = Winter 2009|accessdate = 2013-09-29|publisher = ''[[The Independent Review]]''}}</ref> It received a scathing critique by Rupert Read in the ''[[European Review]]''.<ref name=Read2010>{{cite journal|last1=Read|first1=Rupert|title=Economist-kings?

These reviews appear to have failed to note that Caplan’s book celebrates the market and denigrates democracy at the very time when markets worldwide have failed and democracies have ridden to the rescue. It thus appears to have been undermined fatally by events that occurred as it was published (and which Caplan artfully omits to mention in the more recent paperback edition). Caplan’s book in fact stands in the long tradition of anti-democratic writings that argue that an elite must rule. An elite of free-market economists. An elite no longer in good odour, since the financial crisis (and the climate crisis) occurred and became starkly evident to all. This Critical Notice also points out that numerous of Caplan’s key claims, such as that individual voters have zero effect on election results, are empirically false.}}</ref>

===''Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids''===
''[[Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids]]'' is a 2011 book arguing that people often work too hard in child-rearing, and as a result, they are scared of the idea of having kids. Caplan's book urged parents to relax with respect to child-rearing. The book argues that as the perceived costs (in terms of child-rearing expense and effort) of having kids fell, it made sense to have more kids based on the basic theory of supply and demand.<ref name="parenting.harder">{{cite news|last1=Davis|first1=Tanika|title=Are parents making parenting harder than it has to be?|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/features/maryland-family/bs-lt-tanika-davis-family-1018-20151012-story.html|accessdate=29 September 2016|publisher=Baltimore Sun|date=15 Oct 2015}}</ref> The book was reviewed in ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703806304576242661295724864|title = Go Ahead, Have Another|last = Last|first = Jonathan|date = 2011-04-16|accessdate = 2013-09-29|publisher = ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''}}</ref> The book was also reviewed by ''[[The Guardian]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/may/15/parenting-less-fuss-more-fun|title = Parenting guru Bryan Caplan prescribes less fuss – and more fun|last = McVeigh|first = Tracy|publisher = ''[[The Guardian]]''|date = 2011-05-15|accessdate = 2013-09-29}}</ref> [[RealClearMarkets]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearmarkets.com/articles/2011/08/04/book_review_bryan_caplans_selfish_reasons_to_have_more_kids_99162.html|title = Book Review: Bryan Caplan's Selfish Reasons To Have More Kids|last = Tamny|first = John|publisher = ''[[RealClearMarkets]]''|date = 2011-08-04|accessdate = 2013-09-29}}</ref> and the ''[[Washington Times]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/may/4/go-and-multiply-without-guilt/|title = Go and Multiply, Without Guilt|last = Russell|first = Nicole|date = 2011-05-04|accessdate = 2013-09-29|publisher = ''[[Washington Times]]''}}</ref> The book also led to debates sponsored by the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''<ref name=carroll-wilkinson-wsj-debate>{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/ideas-market/2011/04/14/live-chat-should-you-have-more-kids/|title = Live Chat: Should You Have More Kids?|date = 2011-04-14|accessdate = 2015-06-20|publisher = ''[[The Guardian]]''}}</ref> and ''[[The Guardian]]''.<ref name=caplan-chua-guardian-debate/> ''[[The Guardian]]'' had Caplan debating "Tiger Mom" [[Amy Chua]] on the merits of strict [[parenting|parenting style]].<ref name=caplan-chua-guardian-debate>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/jun/11/conversation-strict-parenting-amy-chua|title = Is strict parenting better for children?|last = Saner|first = Emine|date = 2011-06-11|accessdate = 2013-09-18|publisher = ''[[The Guardian]]''}}</ref> The book was also featured in a story on [[National Public Radio]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Inskeep|first1=Steve|author2=David Greene|author3=Renee Montagne|title='Selfish Reasons' For Parents To Enjoy Having Kids|url=http://www.npr.org/2011/04/22/135612560/selfish-reasons-for-parents-to-enjoy-having-kids|accessdate=29 September 2016|work=[[Morning Edition]]|publisher=National Public Radio|date=22 Apr 2011}}</ref>

===Ayn Rand and Objectivism===
After having long shed a youthful infatuation with the works of [[Russian American]] writer [[Ayn Rand]] and her philosophical system of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]], in 2004 Caplan wrote in his essay 'An Intellectual Biography', "I rejected Christianity because I determined that it was, to be blunt, [[anti-Christian sentiment|idiotic]]. I rejected Objectivism and Austrianism, in contrast, as mixtures of deep truths and unfortunate mistakes. Let me begin with the deep truths. The Objectivists were right to insist that [[philosophical realism|reality is objective]], human reason [[direct realism|able to grasp it]], and [[skepticism|scepticism]] without merit. They correctly hold that humans have [[libertarianism (metaphysics)|free will]], [[moral universalism|morality is objective]], and the pursuit of [[self-interest]] typically [[ethical egoism|morally right]]."<ref name="Walter">{{cite book|author=Block, Walter|title=I Chose Liberty: Autobiographies of Contemporary Libertarians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nONs9lus-zgC&pg=PT85|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|isbn=978-1-61016-270-8|page=85}}</ref>
