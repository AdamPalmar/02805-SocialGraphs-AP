==Life==

Raimund Gaita (later styled as Raimond Gaita) was born in [[Dortmund]], Westphalia, Germany, on 14 May 1946, to a Yugoslav-born, Romanian father, Romulus Gaiţă (28 December 1922{{spaced ndash}}May 1996) and a German mother, Christel "Christine" Anna Dörr (16 November 1928{{spaced ndash}}1958).<ref name="NAA Romulus">{{cite web | url = http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/Gallery151/dist/JGalleryViewer.aspx?B=4105197&S=1&N=27#/SearchNRetrieve/NAAMedia/ShowImage.aspx?B=4105197&T=P&S=1 | title = Digital Item Page Gallery: A12025, 724-726: Gaita Romulus born 28 December 1922; Christine born 6 November 1928; Raimund [Raimond] born 14 May 1946 | publisher = [[National Archives of Australia]] | accessdate = 28 August 2016 }}</ref> In Germany from 1942 to 1945 Romulus was employed as a smith and metal worker.<ref name="NAA Romulus"/> The Gaita family migrated to Australia in April 1950, just before Raimond turned four.<ref name="NAA Christine">{{cite web | url = http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/Gallery151/dist/JGalleryViewer.aspx?B=30263624&S=1&N=5#/SearchNRetrieve/NAAMedia/ShowImage.aspx?B=30263624&T=P&S=1 | title = Digital Item Page Gallery: B78, Yugoslavian/Gaita Christine: Gaita Christine – Nationality: Yugoslavian – Arrived Melbourne per General M L Hersey 27 April 1950 | publisher = National Archives of Australia | accessdate = 28 August 2016 }}</ref> He attended [[St. Patrick's College, Ballarat]] ([[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]), [[Melbourne High School]] (Victoria), the [[University of Melbourne]] (BA Hons, MA) and the [[University of Leeds]] (PhD).

The story of his childhood and the lives of his family members and close friends is told in his memoir ''[[Romulus, My Father]]'', which was made into a film starring [[Eric Bana]] (Romulus), [[Franka Potente]] (Christine), [[Kodi Smit-McPhee]] (Raimond) and [[Marton Csokas]] (Hora). In a later book, ''After Romulus, a collection of essays'', "he reflects on the writing of the ''Romulus, My Father'', the making of the film, his relationship to the desolate beauty of the central Victorian landscape, the philosophies that underpinned his father's relationship to the world and, most movingly, the presence and absence of his mother and his unassuaged longing for her". (from the publisher)

He is married to [[Yael Gaita]], who was born in [[Tel Aviv]] and until 2008 was a teacher at [[King David School, Melbourne]], where she taught [[Hebrew]]. Gaita has two children, Katerina and Eva and two step children, Dahlia and Michelle.
