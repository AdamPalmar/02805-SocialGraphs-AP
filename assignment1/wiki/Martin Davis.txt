==Biography==
Davis's parents were Jewish immigrants to the US from [[Łódź]], [[Poland]], and married after they met again in [[New York City]]. Davis grew up in the [[Bronx]], where his parents encouraged him to obtain a full education.<ref name="jackson"/><ref name="mactutor"/>

He received his Ph.D. from [[Princeton University]] in 1950, where his advisor was [[Alonzo Church]].<ref name="jackson"/><ref name="mactutor"/><ref>{{MathGenealogy|id=8018}}</ref> He is [[Professor Emeritus]] at [[New York University]].

==Contributions==
Davis is the co-inventor of the [[Davis–Putnam algorithm]] and the [[DPLL algorithm]]s. He is also known for his model of [[Post–Turing machine]]s.

==Awards and honors==
In 1975, Davis won the [[Leroy P. Steele Prize]], the [[Chauvenet Prize]] (with [[Reuben Hersh]]), and in 1974 the [[Lester R. Ford]] Award for his expository writlng related to his work on Hilbert's tenth problem.<ref name="mactutor"/><ref>{{cite journal|author=Davis, Martin|title=Hilbert's tenth problem is unsolvable|journal=Amer.

He became a [[fellow]] of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1982,<ref name="mactutor"/> and in 2012, he was selected as one of the inaugural fellows of the [[American Mathematical Society]].<ref>[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2014-03-17.</ref>
