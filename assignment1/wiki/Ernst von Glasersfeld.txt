'''Ernst von Glasersfeld''' (March 8, 1917 in [[Munich]] &ndash; November 12, 2010 in [[Leverett, Massachusetts|Leverett]], [[Franklin County, Massachusetts]]) was a [[philosopher]], and [[Emeritus Professor]] of [[Psychology]] at the [[University of Georgia]], Research Associate at the [[Scientific Reasoning Research Institute]], and Adjunct Professor in the Department of Psychology at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]]. He was a member of the Board of Trustees, [[American Society of Cybernetics]], from which he received the [[McCulloch Memorial Award]] in 1991. He was a member of the Scientific Board, [[Instituto Piaget]], [[Lisbon]].

Von Glasersfeld was born in [[Munich]], where his father, Leopold, worked as [[Vienna]]'s cultural attaché before going into photography after WWI. He was a student of [[mathematics]] at the [[university of Vienna]] before having to move out because of the [[Nazi]] threat, considering that his [[Pan-European identity|Pan-European]] family (they subscribed to the ideology of [[Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi]]) was known to be "enemies of any form of nationalism" and his grandfather was [[Jewish]] (a convert to [[Roman Catholicism]].)<ref>Gisela Holfter & Horst Dickel, ''An Irish Sanctuary: German-speaking Refugees in Ireland 1933–1945'', Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG (2016), p. 94</ref> He thus spent large parts of his life in [[Ireland]] (1940s), in [[Italy]] (1950s) where he worked with [[Silvio Ceccato]], and in the [[United States|US]]. Elaborating upon [[Giambattista Vico]], [[Jean Piaget]]'s genetic [[epistemology]], [[Bishop Berkeley]]'s theory of perception, [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'', and other important texts, von Glasersfeld developed his model of [[Constructivist epistemology#Radical constructivism|Radical Constructivism]], which is an [[ethos]] shared by all of these writers to one degree or another.

Ernst von Glasersfeld’s literary estate is administered and curated at the Ernst-von-Glasersfeld-Archive at the University of Innsbruck.
