'''Ivan Sviták''' (10 October 1925 in [[Hranice na Moravě]] &ndash; 20 October 1994 in [[Prague]]) was a Czech philosopher, critic, and poet who ranked among Europe's most prominent proponents of [[Marxist humanism]]. In a vast oeuvre of essays, Sviták addressed questions of democracy and socialism, of art in bureaucratic and consumer societies, and of the "unbearable burden" of political catastrophe in Czech history.<ref>''The Unbearable Burden of History: The Sovietization of Czechoslovakia'', Academia, 1990.</ref> In addition, Sviták wrote an extensive body of fiction and poetry, in which he "sought a unity of philosophy, literature, and politics, a unity of engagement, wisdom, and poetry."<ref>''Nevědecká antropologie : dialectica modo bohemico demonstrata'' ("Unscientific Anthropology"), Chico, California, 1984, p. 194.</ref> In this, Sviták consciously followed in the footsteps of the [[surrealism|surrealist]] movement that he admired and critically defended on numerous occasions<ref>e.g. "The Surrealist Image of Humankind," ''Cultural Correspondence'', No. 12-13-14, 1981</ref>

In the 1960s, Sviták was one of [[Czechoslovakia]]'s most vocal advocates of [[Prague Spring|democratic socialism]] (a distinction he shared with [[Karel Kosík]], Czechoslovakia's other prominent Marxist humanist philosopher). After the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968, Sviták was stripped of his citizenship and sentenced to a lengthy jail term. Instead of serving the jail term, he chose to emigrate,<ref>As reported by Sviták himself on the jacket of books published after that period.</ref> first to [[New York City]] and in 1970 to [[Chico, California]], where he was offered an academic position. Sviták worked at [[Cal State Chico]] until 1990, when he returned to Czechoslovakia after the end of [[Communist Party]] rule. In the early 1990s Sviták remained a staunch proponent of [[democratic socialism]], turning his critical pen to the new, [[post-Communist]] regime.<ref>''Ztracené iluze : výroční zpráva o sametové revoluci'', Prague 1990.</ref> He died in [[Prague]] in 1994.
