'''Michael Davis''' (born 6 February 1943) is an American philosopher specializing in professional ethics. He is Professor of Philosophy at the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]], and Senior Fellow at its [[Center for the Study of Ethics in the Professions]].

Davis is the author of several books, including ''Accountability in the Professions'' (1995), ''Profession, Code, and Ethics'' (2002), and ''Engineering Ethics'' (2005).

==Background==
Davis received his PhD in 1972 from the [[University of Michigan]] for a dissertation entitled "Representation and Consent: An Inquiry into the Foundations of Political Obligation." Before moving to the Illinois Institute of Technology in 1986, he taught at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]], [[Illinois State University]], and [[Case Western Reserve University]].<ref name=cv>[http://humansciences.iit.edu/faculty/michael-davis "Michael Davis"] and [http://humansciences.iit.edu/sites/humanscience/files/field_uploads/faculty/Davis_VITA%20October%202014.pdf Curriculum Vitae], IIT Lewis College of Human Sciences.</ref>

==Research interests==
Davis's work in [[engineering ethics]] has won him four large grants from the [[National Science Foundation]] and an entry in ''[[Who's Who in Science and Engineering]]''. His papers on [[whistleblowing]] and [[conflict of interest]] are often reprinted.<ref>See, for example, Michael Davis, "Whistleblowing," in Hugh LaFollette (ed.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Practical Ethics'', Oxford University Press, 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sybd1C5zWkoC&pg=PA539 p. 539ff].</ref> He is the author of eight books and almost 200 articles and chapters, and editor (or co-editor) of five other books.<ref>Note: Davis should not be confused with the philosopher Michael Davis who has taught at [[Sarah Lawrence College]] since 1977, and whose work primarily concerns Aristotle, Plato and Greek Tragedy.</ref>
