'''Peter Albert Railton''' (born May 23, 1950) is an American [[philosopher]] who is Gregory S. Kavka Distinguished University Professor and John Stephenson Perrin Professor of [[Philosophy]] at the [[University of Michigan, Ann Arbor]], where he has taught since 1979.<ref>https://www.lsa.umich.edu/UMICH/philosophy/Home/People/Faculty/Railton%20CV-Curr-April%202013.pdf</ref>  He has also been a visiting professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and [[Princeton University]]. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts & Sciences]] in 2004.<ref>http://www.umich.edu/~urecord/0304/May10_04/08.shtml 4 U-M scholars named AAAS fellows</ref>

==Education and career==

He received his Ph.D. from Princeton in 1980, writing a dissertation under the supervision of [[David K. Lewis]]. Although his dissertation concerned scientific explanation, on which he has published several articles, his main research since centers on contemporary [[metaethics]] and [[normative ethics]], especially [[consequentialism]]. He is the author of the book ''Facts, Norms, and Values'' (Cambridge University Press, 2003), a collection of his major papers in ethics, and a co-editor (with [[Stephen Darwall]] and [[Allan Gibbard]]) of ''Moral Discourse and Practice: Some Philosophical Approaches'' (Oxford University Press, 1996).

A public lecture he gave concerning his own struggles with depression attracted widespread notice and praise in the academic community.<ref>https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/02/25/professors-reflections-his-battle-depression-touch-many-recent-disciplinary-meeting</ref>

==Moral Realism==

Railton has playfully described himself as a "stark, raving moral realist".<ref>
"Moral Realism", ''The Philosophical Review'', Vol. 95, No. 2 (April 1986), p. 165</ref> However, unlike some moral realists, he thinks moral facts that make moral statements true are natural facts.
