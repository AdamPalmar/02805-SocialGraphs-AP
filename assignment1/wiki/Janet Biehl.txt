== Education ==
Biehl grew up in Cincinnati, Ohio, and attended [[Wesleyan University]], graduating in 1974 as a theater major.  She studied acting as well as set and costume design at the [[Eugene O'Neill Theater Center]]. She then moved to New York City, where she appeared in off-off-Broadway productions, including the world premiere of [[Fefu and Her Friends]] by Maria Irene Fornes. She made her living as a copyeditor for major book publishers. She studied drawing and watercolor painting at the [[Art Students League of New York]]. In 1985 she enrolled at the CUNY Graduate Center, where she earned an M.A. in liberal studies. In 1986 she attended the [[Institute for Social Ecology]], in Vermont, where she met the social theorist Murray Bookchin. In January 1987 she moved to [[Burlington, Vermont]], to study further with Bookchin. They began a collaborative relationship to advance and promote social ecology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cedap.assis.unesp.br/cantolibertario/textos/0022.html |title=Janet Biehl: Short Biography & Selected Works |publisher=Canto Libertário |accessdate=19 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402155302/http://www.cedap.assis.unesp.br/cantolibertario/textos/0022.html |archivedate= 2 April 2012 |df= }}</ref>

== Career ==
From 1987 to 2003 they co-wrote and co-published the theoretical newsletter ''Green Perspectives'', later renamed ''Left Green Perspectives''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.social-ecology.org/category/social-ecology-journals/left-green-perspectives/|title=Left Green Perspectives (1988-1998)|publisher=Institute for Social Ecology|accessdate=19 September 2011}}</ref> BIehl edited and compiled ''The Murray Bookchin Reader'' (1997), which Bookchin considered to be the best introduction to his work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bookchin/reader/intro.html|title=The Murray Bookchin Reader: Introduction|last=Biehl|first=Janet|publisher=Anarchy Archives|accessdate=19 September 2011}}</ref> To summarize Bookchin's ideas on assembly democracy, known as [[libertarian municipalism]], she wrote ''The Politics of Social Ecology:  Libertarian Municipalism'' (1998). She wrote numerous articles about or related to Bookchin’s  ideas.  

Since Bookchin's death in 2006, she authored ''Ecology or Catastrophe: The  Life of Murray Bookchin,'' published in 2015 by Oxford University Press. In 2011 Biehl separated from social ecology, explaining that she could no longer advocate an antistatist ideology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.social-ecology.org/2011/04/biehl-breaks-with-social-ecology/|title=Biehl breaks with social ecology|last=Biehl|first=Janet|date=April 13, 2011 <!-- at 6:10 am --> |publisher=Institute for Social Ecology|accessdate=19 September 2011}}</ref> She blogs at [http://www.biehlonbookchin.com/ Ecology or Catastrophe].

Biehl is a supporter of the Kurdish freedom movement. After [[Abdullah Öcalan]], leader of the insurgent [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]], was captured and imprisoned in 1999, he became an avid reader of Bookchin's work in Turkish translation and recommended it to the movement. Drawing on libertarian municipalism, he formulated [[democratic confederalism]] as a political program, which the PKK adopted.<ref>Janet Biehl, "Bookchin, Öcalan, and the Dialectics of Democracy," New Compass (2012), http://new-compass.net/articles/bookchin-%C3%B6calan-and-dialectics-democracy</ref> In 2004 several intermediaries tried to arrange a dialogue between Bookchin and Öcalan but were unsuccessful due to Bookchin's failing health. (PDFs of the correspondence are published [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/syrian-kurds-murray-bookchin_us_5655e7e2e4b079b28189e3df here]). In 2012 Biehl translated (German to English) the [http://demokratischeautonomie.blogsport.eu/ book] ''Democratic Autonomy in North Kurdistan'' by the solidarity group TATORT Kurdistan, a field study of democratic institutions built by the Kurdish movement in southeastern Turkey to implement democratic confederalism.

In 2014 and 2015 she visited [[Rojava]], the mostly Kurdish region of northern Syria. There the Kurdish movement is attempting, in wartime conditions, to implement democratic confederalism, gender equality, and ecology.<ref>Wes Enzinna, "A Dream of Secular Utopia in ISIS' Backyard," New York Times Magazine, November 24, 2015, https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/29/magazine/a-dream-of-utopia-in-hell.html?_r=0</ref>  She published several articles about her visits.<ref>Biehl, "Rojava's Communes and Councils," January 31, 2015, http://www.biehlonbookchin.com/rojavas-communes-and-councils/; "Revolutionary Education," February 7, 2015, http://www.biehlonbookchin.com/revolutionary-education/; "Rojava's Threefold Economy," February 25, 2015, http://www.biehlonbookchin.com/rojavas-threefold-economy/; "Thoughts on Rojava," February 16, 2016, http://www.biehlonbookchin.com/thoughts-on-rojava/; and with others, "Joint Statement of the Academic Delegation," January 17, 2015, http://www.biehlonbookchin.com/joint-statement-delegation/</ref> In October 2016 her translation of ''Revolution in Rojava: Democratic Autonomy and Women's Liberation in Northern Syria,'' written by Michael Knapp, Anja Flach, and Ercan Ayboga, was published by Pluto Press.
