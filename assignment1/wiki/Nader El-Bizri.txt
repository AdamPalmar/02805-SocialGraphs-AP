== Ideas ==
El-Bizri's areas of expertise are in [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], in Arabic Sciences and philosophy, and architectural [[humanities]] ([[architectural theory]]).  He focuses mainly on theories of [[space]]/[[Location (geography)|place]] and of [[perception]], with a particular interest in classical [[optics]] and [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] [[Renaissance]] traditions.  His interpretation of [[history of science]] and philosophy is guided by contemporary debates in [[epistemology]] and [[ontology]] ([[metaphysics]]).{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

El-Bizri composed commentaries on phenomenology and [[Martin Heidegger]],<ref>[https://cdn.uclouvain.be/groups/cms-editors-isp/vhousiaux/BHDG-7.pdf] On the impact of Heidegger in the Arab and Muslim world, in "BULLETIN HEIDEGGÉRIEN" 7 (2017), pp. 8-16 {{ISSN|2034-7189}}</ref><ref>[http://studia.ubbcluj.ro/arhiva/abstract_en.php?editie=PHILOSOPHIA&nr=1&an=2015&id_art=13262 Nader El-Bizri, 'On Dwelling: Heideggerian Allusions to Architectural Phenomenology', ''Studia UBB. Philosophia'', Vol. 60, No. 1 (2015): 5-30]</ref> He also developed an expertise in history of philosophy and science in Islamic civilisation, with a special focus on the traditions of polymaths like the optician and geometer [[Alhazen]] (al-Hasan [[Ibn al-Haytham]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.muslimheritage.com/article/nader-el-bizri-ibn-al-haytham-introduction |title=Nader El-Bizri: Ibn al-Haytham – An Introduction |publisher=Muslim Heritage |date=31 December 2005 |accessdate=6 July 2017}}</ref> the metaphysician and physician [[Avicenna]] (Abu 'Ali [[Ibn Sina]]), and the tenth-century encyclopaedist thinkers, the [[Brethren of Purity]] ([[Ikhwan al-Safa']]).<ref>{{cite journal|author=Nader El-Bizri|title=Ikhwān al-Ṣafāʾ: An Islamic Philosophical Fraternity|editor=Houari Touati|journal=Encyclopedia of Mediterranean Humanism|date=2014|url=http://www.encyclopedie-humanisme.com/?Ikhw%C4%81n-al-%E1%B9%A2af%C4%81%CA%BE&var_}}</ref>

El-Bizri's interpretations of the history of the exact sciences in classical Islamic civilisation have been connected with the legacy of the mathematician, historian and philosopher of science: Roshdi Rashed (Emeritus; ''CNRS'', Paris).{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In recent studies that aim at "renewing the impetus of philosophical thinking in Islam", El-Bizri offers critical analyses of the conventions of methodology and historiography that dominate the mainstream academic and epistemic approaches in studying "Islamic philosophy" from "archival" standpoints, within Oriental and Mediaevalist Studies; arguing that these do not usually recognise the fact that "philosophy in Islam" can still be a living intellectual tradition, and that its renewal requires a radical reform in ontology, epistemology and [[cosmology]] within Islamic thought, which have primacy over the emphasis on theories of value, politics and law.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} This is also embodied in El-Bizri's interpretations of Avicenna (Ibn Sina) from the standpoint of Heidegger's critique of the history of metaphysics.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
