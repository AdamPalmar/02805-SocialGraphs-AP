== Life ==
Yi I was born in [[Gangneung]], [[Gangwon-do (South Korea)|Gangwon Province]] in 1537. His father was a Fourth State Councillor (''jwachanseong'' 좌찬성) and his mother, [[Shin Saimdang]], the accomplished artist and [[calligraphy|calligraphist]]. He was the grand nephew of [[Yi Gi]], [[prime minister]] 1549 to 1551.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} early years he was learn of [[Baik In-geol]], successor of [[Jo Gwang-jo]]. late years, It is said that by the age of seven he had finished his lessons in the [[Confucian]] classics, and passed the Civil Service literary examination at the age of 13. Yi I secluded himself in [[Kumgang-san]] following his mother's death when he was 16 and stayed for 3 years, studying [[Buddhism]]. He left the mountains at 20 and devoted himself to the study of [[Confucianism]].<ref name="yi i aks">{{ko}} [http://people.aks.ac.kr/front/tabCon/ppl/pplView.aks?pplId=PPL_6JOa_A1536_1_0010341&isEQ=true&kristalSearchArea=true Yi I] at The Academy of Korean Studies</ref><ref name="yi i ekc">{{ko}} [http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&i=251870&v=44] at Encyclopedia of Korean Culture</ref>

He married at 22 and a half, went to visit [[Yi Hwang]] at [[Dosan Seowon|Dosan]] the following year. He passed special exams with top honors with a winning thesis titled ''Cheondochaek'' (hangul:천도책, hanja: 天道策, "Book on the Way of Heaven"), which was widely regarded as a literary masterpiece, displaying his knowledge of history and the Confucian [[philosophy]] of politics, and also reflecting his profound knowledge of [[Taoism]].<ref>Lee Eunjik(이은직) translated by Jeong Hongjun(정홍준), ''Great Joseon Masters'' Vol.2 (조선명인전 2) p35, Ilbit Publishing, Seoul, 2005. {{ISBN|89-5645-087-0}}</ref> He continuously received top honors on civil exams for a consecutive 9 times. His father died when he was 26.<ref name="yi i doosan"/> He served in various positions in government from the age of 29, and visited the [[Ming Dynasty]] as ''seojanggwan'' (hangul: 서장관, hanja: 書狀官, document officer) in 1568. He also participated in the writing of the ''[[Myeongjong of Joseon|Myeongjong]] Annals'' and at 34, authored ''Dongho Mundap'', an eleven-article political memorial devoted to clarifying his conviction that a righteous government could be achieved.<ref name="Dongho Mundap">{{ko}} [http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=50749 Dongho Mundap] at [[Doosan Encyclopedia]]</ref>

Due to his vast experience in different offices over the years, Yi I was able to garner a wide vision of politics and with the deep trust of the king, became one of the central figures of politics by the time he was 40. His many documents and theses were presented to the royal court but when political conflicts escalated in 1576, his efforts proved fruitless and he returned home. Following his return, he devoted his time to studies and education of his disciples and authored several books.<ref name="yi i doosan"/>

He returned to office at 45 and while holding various minister positions, produced many writings which recorded crucial political events and showed his efforts to ease the political conflicts that were rampant at that time. However, [[Seonjo of Joseon|King Seonjo]] was noncommittal in his attitude and it became difficult for Yi I to remain in a neutral position in the conflicts. He left office in 1583 and died the following year.<ref name="yi i doosan"/>

According to legend, he had a pavilion built near the ford of the [[Imjin River]] in his lifetime and instructed his heirs to set it ablaze when the king had to flee northward from Seoul, to provide a guiding beacon. This took place during Hideyoshi's invasions of Korea at the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592-1598)|Imjin war]].<ref>Choi Beomseo (최범서), ''Unofficial History of Joseon Vol. 2'' p52, Garam Publishing, Seoul, 2003.  {{ISBN|89-8435-143-1}}</ref>

==Teachings==
Yi I was not only known as a philosopher but also as a social reformer. He did not completely agree with the dualistic [[Neo-Confucianism]] teachings followed by [[Yi Hwang]]. His school of [[Neo-Confucianism]] placed emphasis on the more concrete, material elements; rather than inner spiritual perception, this practical and pragmatic approach valued external experience and learning.<ref>Lee Hyun-hee, Park Sung-soo, Yoon Nae-hyun, translated by The Academy of Korean Studies, ''New History of Korea'' p393, Jimoondang, Paju, 2005. {{ISBN|89-88095-85-5}}</ref> Unlike [[Yi Hwang]], who suffered through tumultuous times and did not enjoy being in politics, Yi I was an active official who thought it important to implement Confucian values and principles to government administration. He emphasized sage learning and self-cultivation as the base of proper administration.<ref name="yi i aks"/><ref name="yi i ekc"/>

Yi I is also well known for his foresight about [[national security]]. He proposed to draft and reinforce the army against a possible Japanese attack. His proposal was rejected by the central government, his worry was found to be well-founded soon after his death, during the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)|Imjin war]].<ref name="yi i ekc"/>
