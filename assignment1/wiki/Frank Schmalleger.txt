==Quotes==

*"In order to communicate knowledge we must first catch, then hold, a person’s interest—be it student, colleague, or policymaker. Our writing, our speaking,  our teaching, and our research must be relevant to the problems facing people today, and they must—in some way—help solve those problems."
*"It is my hope that the [[technology|technological]] and [[publishing]] [[revolution]]s will combine with growing social awareness to facilitate needed changes in our system; and will supplant self-serving system-perpetuated injustices with new standards of [[social equality|equity]], compassion, understanding, fairness, and justice for all."
