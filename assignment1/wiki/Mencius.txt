==Life==
[[File:Temple of Mencius - Yasheng Hall - inside - P1050921.JPG|thumb|upright|left|An image of Mencius in the sanctuary of the Mencius Temple, Zoucheng]]
Mencius, also known by his birth name '''Meng Ke''' or '''Meng Ko''' (孟轲), was born in the [[State of Zou]], now forming the territory of the [[county-level city]] of [[Zoucheng]] (originally Zouxian), [[Shandong]] province, only thirty kilometres (eighteen miles) south of [[Qufu]], [[Confucius]]' birthplace.

He was an itinerant [[Chinese philosophy|Chinese philosopher]] and sage, and one of the principal interpreters of [[Confucianism]]. Supposedly, he was a pupil of Confucius' grandson, [[Zisi]]. Like Confucius, according to legend, he travelled throughout China for forty years to offer advice to rulers for reform.<ref>Chan 1963: 49.</ref> During the [[Warring States period]] (403–221 BC), Mencius served as an official and scholar at the [[Jixia Academy]] in the [[State of Qi]] (1046 BC to 221 BC) from 319 to 312 BC. He expressed his [[filial piety|filial devotion]] when he took three years leave of absence from his official duties for Qi to mourn his mother's death. Disappointed at his failure to effect changes in his contemporary world, he retired from public life.

Mencius is buried in the "Mencius Cemetery" (孟子林, ''Mengzi Lin'', also known as 亚圣林, ''Yasheng Lin''), which is located 12&nbsp;km to the northeast of Zoucheng's central urban area. A [[stele]] carried by a giant [[bixi (tortoise)|stone tortoise]] and crowned with dragons stands in front of his grave.<ref>[http://www.infobase.gov.cn/intro/fjms/l8/l8016/index.htm 孟子林] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120805110526/http://www.infobase.gov.cn/intro/fjms/l8/l8016/index.htm |date=2012-08-05 }} (Mencius Cemetery)</ref>

===Mencius's mother===
Mencius's mother is often held up as an exemplary female figure in Chinese culture. One of the most famous traditional Chinese [[Chengyu|four-character idioms]] is {{linktext|孟母三遷}} ({{zh|p=mèngmǔ-sānqiān|l=Mencius's mother, three moves}}); this saying refers to the legend that Mencius's mother moved houses three times before finding a location that she felt was suitable for the child's upbringing. As an expression, the idiom refers to the importance of finding the proper environment for raising children.

Mencius's father died when he was very young. His mother Zhǎng (仉) raised her son alone. They were very poor. At first they lived by a cemetery, where the mother found her son imitating the paid mourners in funeral processions. Therefore, the mother decided to move. The next house was near a market in the town. There the boy began to imitate the cries of merchants (merchants were despised in early China). So the mother moved to a house next to a school. Inspired by the scholars and students, Mencius began to study. His mother decided to remain, and Mencius became a scholar.

Another story further illustrates the emphasis that Mencius's mother placed on her son's education. As the story goes, once when Mencius was young, he was truant from school. His mother responded to his apparent disregard for his education by taking up a pair of scissors and cutting the cloth she had been weaving in front of him. This was intended to illustrate that one cannot stop a task midway, and her example inspired Mencius to diligence in his studies.

There is another legend about his mother and his wife, involving a time when his wife was at home alone and was discovered by Mencius not to be sitting properly. Mencius thought his wife had violated a rite, and demanded a divorce. His mother claimed that it was written in The Book of Rites that before a person entered a room, he should announce his imminent presence loudly to let others prepare for his arrival; as he had not done that in this case, the person who had violated the rite was Mencius himself. Eventually Mencius admitted his fault.

She is one of 125 women of which biographies have been included in the [[Lienü zhuan]], written by [[Liu Xiang (scholar)|Liu Xiang]].

===Descendants===
[[Duke Huan of Lu]]'s son through Qingfu (慶父) was the ancestor of Mencius. He was descended from Duke Yang of the [[State of Lu]] 魯煬公 Duke Yang was the son of [[Bo Qin]], who was the son of the [[Duke of Zhou]] of the [[Zhou dynasty]] royal family. The genealogy is found in the Mencius family tree (孟子世家大宗世系).<ref>《三遷志》，（清）孟衍泰續修</ref><ref>《孟子世家譜》，（清）孟廣均主編，1824年</ref><ref>《孟子與孟氏家族》，孟祥居編，2005年</ref>

Mencius' descendants lived in [[Zoucheng]] in the Mencius Family Mansion, where the Mencius Temple was also built and also a cemetery for Mencius' descendants.

[[Meng Haoran]] and [[Meng Jiao]] were descendants of Mencius who lived during the [[Tang dynasty]].

During the [[Ming dynasty]], one of Mencius' descendants was given a hereditary title at the [[Hanlin Academy]] by the Emperor. The title they held was Wujing Boshi (五经博士; [[w:zh:五經博士|五經博士]]; Wǔjīng Bóshì).<ref name="BrunnertHagelstrom2013">{{cite book|author1=H.S. Brunnert|author2=V.V.

One of Mencius's direct descendants was Dr. Meng Chih (Anglicised as Dr. Paul Chih Meng) former director of China House, and director of the China Institute in 1944. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine reported Dr. Meng's age that year as 44.

==Influence==

Mencius's interpretation of Confucianism has generally been considered the orthodox version by subsequent Chinese philosophers, especially by the [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucians]] of the [[Song dynasty]].  Mencius's disciples included a large number of feudal lords, and he was actually more influential than Confucius had been.<ref name="test">Charles O. Hucker, ''China to 1850: A Short History'', Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1978, p. 45</ref> The ''Mencius'' (also spelled ''Mengzi'' or ''Meng-tzu''), a book of his conversations with kings of the time, is one of the [[Four Books]] that [[Zhu Xi]] grouped as the core of orthodox Neo-Confucian thought. In contrast to the sayings of Confucius, which are short and self-contained, the ''Mencius'' consists of long dialogues, including arguments, with extensive prose.

==Main concepts==

===On Human Nature===

While Confucius himself did not explicitly focus on the subject of human nature, Mencius asserted the innate goodness of the individual, believing that it was society's influence – its lack of a positive cultivating influence – that caused bad [[moral character]]. "He who exerts his mind to the utmost knows his nature"<ref>The ''Mencius'' 7:A1 in Chan 1963: 78.</ref> and "the way of learning is none other than finding the lost mind."<ref>The ''Mencius'' 6:A11 in Chan 1963: 58.</ref>

His translator [[James Legge]] finds a close similarity between Mencius's views on human nature and those in [[Joseph Butler|Bishop Butler]]'s ''Sermons on Human Nature''.

===The Four Beginnings (or Sprouts)===
To show innate goodness, Mencius used the example of a child falling down a well. Witnesses of this event immediately feel {{cquote|alarm and distress, not to gain friendship with the child's parents, nor to seek the praise of their neighbors and friends, nor because they dislike the reputation [of lack of humanity if they did not rescue the child]...

The feeling of commiseration is the beginning of humanity;
the feeling of shame and dislike is the beginning of righteousness;
the feeling of deference and compliance is the beginning of propriety;
and the feeling of right or wrong is the beginning of [[wisdom]].

Men have these Four Beginnings just as they have their four limbs. Having these Four Beginnings, but saying that they cannot develop them is to destroy themselves.<ref>The ''Mencius'' 2A:6 in Chan 1963: 65. Formatting has been applied to ease readability.</ref>}}

Human nature has an innate tendency towards goodness, but moral rightness cannot be instructed down to the last detail.  This is why merely external controls always fail in improving society.  True improvement results from educational cultivation in favorable environments.  Likewise, bad environments tend to corrupt the human will. This, however, is not proof of innate evil because a clear thinking person would avoid causing harm to others.  This position of Mencius puts him between Confucians such as Xunzi who thought people were innately bad, and Taoists who believed humans did not need cultivation, they just needed to accept their innate, natural, and effortless goodness.  The four beginnings/sprouts could grow and develop, or they could fail. In this way Mencius synthesized integral parts of Taoism into Confucianism.  Individual effort was needed to cultivate oneself, but one's natural tendencies were good to begin with. The object of education is the cultivation of benevolence, otherwise known as [[Ren (Confucianism)|Ren]].

===Education===
According to Mencius, education must awaken the innate abilities of the human mind.  He denounced memorization and advocated active interrogation of the text, saying, "One who believes all of a book would be better off without books" (盡信書，則不如無書, from 孟子.盡心下). One should check for internal consistency by comparing sections and debate the probability of factual accounts by comparing them with experience.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===Destiny===

Mencius also believed in the power of Destiny in shaping the roles of human beings in society.  What is destined cannot be contrived by the human intellect or foreseen.   Destiny is shown when a path arises that is both unforeseen and constructive.    Destiny should not be confused with Fate.  Mencius denied that Heaven would protect a person regardless of his actions, saying, "One who understands Destiny will not stand beneath a tottering wall".  The proper path is one which is natural and unforced.  This path must also be maintained because, "Unused pathways are covered with weeds."  One who follows Destiny will live a long and successful life.  One who rebels against Destiny will die before his time.

===View on politics===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Life of Mencius.jpg|thumb|210px|right|"The Life of Mencius" pictures Mencius walking with the King of [[Teng (state)|Teng]], discussing his philosophy that all men have innate benevolence.]] -->

Mencius emphasized the significance of the common citizens in the state. While Confucianism generally regards rulers highly, he argued that it is acceptable for the subjects to overthrow or even kill a ruler who ignores the people's needs and rules harshly. This is because a ruler who does not rule justly is no longer a true ruler. Speaking of the overthrow of the wicked [[King Zhou of Shang]], Mencius said, "I have merely heard of killing a villain Zhou, but I have not heard of murdering [him as] the ruler."<ref>The ''Mencius'' 1B:8 in Chan 1963: 62.</ref>

This saying should not be taken as an instigation to violence against authorities but as an application of Confucian philosophy to society.  Confucianism requires a clarification of what may be reasonably expected in any given relationship.  All relationships should be beneficial, but each has its own principle or inner logic.  A Ruler must justify his position by acting benevolently before he can expect reciprocation from the people.  In this view, a King is like a steward.  Although Confucius admired Kings of great accomplishment, Mencius is clarifying the proper hierarchy of human society.  Although a King has presumably higher status than a commoner, he is actually subordinate to the masses of people and the resources of society.  Otherwise, there would be an implied disregard of the potential of human society heading into the future.  One is significant only for what one gives, not for what one takes.

==Comparisons to contemporaries==
His alleged years make him contemporary with [[Xun Zi]], [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]], [[Gaozi]], and [[Plato]].

===Xun Zi===
[[Xun Zi]] was a Confucian who believed that human nature is centered on self-interest and greed, and the purpose of moral cultivation is to develop our nature into goodness. This put him at odds with Mencius. Later, the thinker [[Zhu Xi]] declared  the views of Xun Zi to be unorthodox, instead supporting the position of Mencius.

===Plato===
Mencius's argument that unjust rulers may be overthrown is reminiscent of [[Socrates]]' argument in Book I of Plato's ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''.
