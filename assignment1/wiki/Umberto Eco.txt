'''Umberto Eco''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic|OMRI]]}} ({{IPA-it|umˈbɛrto ˈɛːko|lang}}; 5 January 1932 – 19 February 2016) was an Italian novelist, [[Literary criticism|literary critic]], [[philosopher]], [[semiotics|semiotician]], and university professor. He is best known internationally for his 1980 novel ''Il nome della rosa'' (''[[The Name of the Rose]]''), a [[historical mystery]] combining semiotics in [[fiction]] with [[bible|biblical]] analysis, medieval studies, and [[literary theory]]. He later wrote other novels, including ''Il pendolo di Foucault'' (''[[Foucault's Pendulum]]'') and ''L'isola del giorno prima'' (''[[The Island of the Day Before]]''). His novel ''Il cimitero di Praga'' (''[[The Prague Cemetery]]''), released in 2010, topped the bestseller charts in Italy.<ref name="Thomson 2016">{{cite web | last=Thomson | first=Ian | title=Umberto Eco obituary | website=the Guardian | date=20 Feb 2016 | url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/20/umberto-eco-obituary | accessdate=1 Mar 2017}}</ref>

Eco was honored with the ''[[Kenyon Review]]'' Award for Literary Achievement in 2005 along with [[Roger Angell]].<ref name=kenyon>{{cite web|title=Roger Angell and Umberto Eco|url=http://www.kenyonreview.org/programs/kenyon-review-award-for-literary-achievement/roger-angell-and-umberto-eco/|publisher=The Kenyon Review|accessdate=27 February 2013}}</ref>

==Life==
Eco was born in the city of [[Alessandria]], in [[Piedmont]] in northern Italy. His father, Giulio, one of thirteen children, was an accountant before the government called him to serve in three wars. During [[World War II]], Umberto and his mother, Giovanna (Bisio), moved to a small village in the Piedmontese mountainside.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/umberto-eco|title=Umberto Eco Biography|work=eNotes |accessdate=23 April 2016 }}</ref> Eco received a [[Salesian]] education and made references to the order and its founder in his works and interviews.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.sdb.ph/sdb4/N7/20040644ENG.doc|title=Don Bosco in Umberto Eco's latest book|journal=N7: News publication for the Salesian community|page=4|date=June 2004|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306042413/http://www.sdb.ph/sdb4/N7/20040644ENG.doc |archivedate=6 March 2009}}</ref> His family name is supposedly an acronym of ''ex caelis oblatus'' (from Latin: a gift from the heavens), which was given to his grandfather (a [[Child abandonment|foundling]]) by a city official.

Umberto's father urged him to become a lawyer, but he entered the [[University of Turin]] to take up medieval philosophy and literature, writing his thesis on [[Thomas Aquinas]] and earning a [[Laurea#Former status of the Laurea degree|Laurea degree]] in [[philosophy]] in 1954. During his university studies, Eco stopped believing in God and left the [[Catholic Church]].<ref name="Time05">{{Citation|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1069054-2,00.html |title=A Resounding Eco |newspaper=Time |date=13 June 2005 |accessdate=1 June 2007 |quote=His new book touches on politics, but also on faith.

A group of [[avant-garde]] artists, painters, musicians and writers, whom he had befriended at RAI (Gruppo 63), became an important and influential component in Eco's writing career. This was especially true after the publication of his first book in 1956, ''Il problema estetico in San Tommaso'', which was an extension of his Laurea thesis. This also marked the beginning of his lecturing career at his [[alma mater]].

In September 1962 he married Renate Ramge, a German art teacher with whom he had a son and a daughter.

He divided his time between an apartment in [[Milan]] and a vacation house near [[Urbino]]. He had a 30,000 volume [[library]] in the former and a 20,000 volume library in the latter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3642577/Heavyweight-champion.html|title=Heavyweight champion|accessdate=23 October 2009|last=Farndale|first=Nigel|date=24 May 2005|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref> He was a visiting professor at [[Columbia University]] several times in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1992–1993 Eco was the Norton professor at [[Harvard University]]. On 8 May 1993, Eco received an honorary [[Doctor of Humane Letters]] (D.H.L.) from [[Indiana University Bloomington]] in recognition of his over fifteen-year association with the university's Research Center for Language and Semiotic Studies. Six books that were authored, co-authored, or co-edited by Eco were published by the Indiana University Press. He frequently collaborated with his friend [[Thomas Sebeok]], semiotician and Distinguished Professor of Linguistics at Indiana University. He became [[Satrap]] of the Collège de ‘Pataphysique in 2001. On 23 May 2002, Eco received an honorary [[Doctor of Letters]] (D.Litt.) from [[Rutgers University]] in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]], [[New Jersey]].

==Professional and academic activity==

===Studies on medieval aesthetics===
In 1959 Eco published his second book, ''Sviluppo dell'estetica medievale'' (''The Development of Medieval Aesthetics''), on [[medieval philosophy]]. After 18 months' military service in the [[Italian Army]], he left RAI in 1959 to become the senior non-fiction editor of the [[Bompiani]] publishing house in Milan, a position he occupied until 1975.

===Literary criticism===
Eco began seriously developing his ideas on the "open" text and on semiotics, writing many essays on these subjects, and in 1962 he published ''Opera aperta'' (translated into English as "The Open Work"). In it, Eco argued that literary texts are fields of meaning, rather than strings of meaning, that they are understood as open, internally dynamic and psychologically engaged fields. Literature which limits one's potential understanding to a single, unequivocal line, the ''closed text'', remains the least rewarding, while texts that are the most active between mind, society and life ([[open text]]s) are the liveliest and best—although valuation terminology is not his primary focus. Eco came to these positions through study of language and from semiotics, rather than from psychology or historical analysis (as did theorists such as [[Wolfgang Iser]], on the one hand, and [[Hans Robert Jauss]], on the other).

===Studies on media culture===
Eco's short 1961 essay "Fenomenologia di Mike Bongiorno" ("Phenomenology of [[Mike Bongiorno]]", on the most popular [[quiz show]] host in Italy) received much notoriety among the general public and has drawn endless questions by journalists at every public appearance by Eco; the essay was later included in the collection ''Diario minimo'' (1963). His book ''Apocalittici e integrati'' (1964) analyzes the phenomenon of mass communication from a sociological perspective.

In 1967 he gave the influential<ref>{{cite book|last=Strangelove|first=Michael|date=2005|title=The Empire of Mind: Digital Piracy and the Anti-Capitalist Movement|publisher=University of Toronto Press|pages=104–5|isbn=0802038182}}</ref> lecture "Towards a Semiological Guerrilla Warfare", which coined the influential term "[[semiological guerrilla]]," and influenced the theorization of guerrilla tactics against [[mainstream]] [[mass media culture]], such as [[guerrilla television]] and [[culture jamming]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Among the expressions used in the essay are "communications guerrilla warfare" and "cultural guerrilla."<ref name="Eco67Guerrilla">Eco (1967)</ref><ref name="Bondanella05">Bondanella (2005) pp. 53, 88–9.</ref> The essay was later included in Eco's book ''[[Faith in Fakes]]''.

In 2012, Eco and [[Jean-Claude Carrière]] published a book of conversations on the future of information carriers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/27/end-book-eco-carriere-review|title=This is Not the End of the Book by Umberto Eco and Jean-Claude Carrière – review|last=Clee|first=Nicholas|date=27 May 2012|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=21 February 2016}}</ref> Eco has criticized social networks saying for example that ''“Social media gives legions of idiots the right to speak when they once only spoke at a bar after a glass of wine, without harming the community [...] but now they have the same right to speak as a Nobel Prize winner. It’s the invasion of the idiots.”''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://comipi.wordpress.com/2015/06/18/the-invasion-of-the-idiots-and-modern-churnalism/|title=About idiots and churnalism|last=fveltri|website=News Of PR Interest|access-date=2016-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lastampa.it/2015/06/10/cultura/eco-con-i-parola-a-legioni-di-imbecilli-XJrvezBN4XOoyo0h98EfiJ/pagina.html|title=Umberto Eco: "Con i social parola a legioni di imbecilli"|website=LaStampa.it|access-date=2017-05-31}}</ref>

===Semiotics===
[[File:Umberto Eco 04.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Umberto Eco in 2005]]
Eco founded and developed one of the most important approaches in contemporary semiotics, usually referred to as interpretative semiotics. The main books in which he elaborates his theory are ''La struttura assente'' (1968; literally: ''The Absent Structure''), ''A Theory of Semiotics'' (1975), ''The Role of the Reader'' (1979), ''Semiotics and Philosophy of Language'' (1984), ''The Limits of Interpretation'' (1990), ''[[Kant and the Platypus]]'' (1997), and ''From the Tree to the Labyrinth: Historical Studies on the Sign and Interpretation'' (2014).

Eco co-founded ''[[Versus (journal)|Versus: Quaderni di studi semiotici]]'' (known as ''VS ''among Italian academics), a semiotic journal. ''VS'' is used by scholars whose work is related to signs and signification. The journal's foundation and activities have contributed to semiotics as an academic field in its own right, both in Italy and in the rest of Europe. Most of the well-known European semioticians, including Eco, [[A. J. Greimas]], Jean-Marie Floch, and [[Jacques Fontanille]], as well as philosophers and linguists like [[John Searle]] and [[George Lakoff]], have published original articles in ''VS''. His work with Serbian and Russian scholars and writers included thought on [[Milorad Pavic]] and a meeting with [[Alexander Genis]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Genis|first1=Daniel|title=Driving Umberto Eco|url=http://airshipdaily.com/blog/10172014-umberto-eco-writer-writing|website=www.airshipdaily.com|accessdate=2 May 2015}}</ref>

===Anthropology===
In 1988, at the University of Bologna, Eco created an unusual program called ''Anthropology of the West'' from the perspective of non-Westerners (African and Chinese scholars), as defined by their own criteria. Eco developed this transcultural international network based on the idea of [[Alain le Pichon]] in [[West Africa]]. The Bologna program resulted in the first conference in [[Guangzhou, China]], in 1991 entitled "Frontiers of Knowledge." The first event was soon followed by an Itinerant Euro-Chinese seminar on "Misunderstandings in the Quest for the Universal" along the silk trade route from [[Guangzhou]] to Beijing. The latter culminated in a book entitled ''The Unicorn and the Dragon'',<ref>''The Unicorn and the Dragon'', Le Pichon, Alain; Yue Dayun (eds.) (1996), Beijing University Press. (bilingual French/English edition)</ref> which discussed the question of the creation of knowledge in China and in Europe. Scholars contributing to this volume were from China, including [[Tang Yijie]], Wang Bin and Yue Daiyun, as well as from Europe: Furio Colombo, [[Antoine Danchin]], [[Jacques Le Goff]], [[Paolo Fabbri]] and [[Alain Rey]].<ref>{{Citation |url=http://carbon.ucdenver.edu/~mryder/itc/eco/intro.html |title=A Conversation on Information |type=interview |first=Patrick |last=Coppock |date=February 1995 |accessdate=9 June 2010 |publisher=UC |place=Denver |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609064331/http://carbon.ucdenver.edu/~mryder/itc/eco/intro.html |archivedate=9 June 2010 |deadurl=yes}}</ref>

In 2000 a seminar in [[Timbuktu]], [[Mali]], was followed up with another gathering in Bologna to reflect on the conditions of reciprocal knowledge between East and West. This in turn gave rise to a series of conferences in [[Brussels]], [[Paris]] and [[Goa]], culminating in Beijing in 2007. The topics of the Beijing conference were "Order and Disorder","New Concepts of War and Peace", "Human Rights" and "Social Justice and Harmony". Eco presented the opening lecture. Among those giving presentations were anthropologists Balveer Arora, Varun Sahni, and [[Rukmini Bhaya Nair]] from India, Moussa Sow from Africa, Roland Marti and [[Maurice Olender]] from Europe, Cha Insuk from Korea, and Huang Ping and Zhao Tinyang from China. Also on the program were scholars from the fields of law and science including [[Antoine Danchin]], Ahmed Djebbar and Dieter Grimm.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2003/665/bo3.htm |title=Vegetal and mineral memory |date=November 2003 |accessdate=1 February 2007 |publisher=Ahgram |place=EG |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040201224219/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2003/665/bo3.htm |archivedate=1 February 2004 |deadurl=yes}} Considers, among other things, [[encyclopedia]]s.</ref> Eco's interest in East-West dialogue to facilitate international communication and understanding also correlates with his related interest in the international auxiliary language [[Esperanto]].

==Style and works==

===Themes===
Eco's fiction has enjoyed a wide audience around the world, with many translations. His novels are full of subtle, often multilingual, references to literature and history. Eco's work illustrates the concept of [[intertextuality]], or the inter-connectedness of all literary works. Eco cited [[James Joyce]] and [[Jorge Luis Borges]] as the two modern authors who have influenced his work the most.<ref>Eco (2006) ''On Literature'' Vintage</ref>

===Selected narrative works===
Eco employed his education as a medievalist in his first novel ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'' (1980), a historical mystery set in a 14th-century monastery. Franciscan friar [[William of Baskerville]], aided by his assistant Adso, a [[Benedictine]] [[Catholic novitiate|novice]], investigates a series of murders at a monastery that is to host an important religious debate. The novel contains many direct or indirect [[metatextuality|metatextual]] references to other sources, requiring the detective work of the reader to 'solve'. The title is unexplained in the book. As a symbol, the rose is ubiquitous enough not to confer any single meaning.<ref>{{cite book|last=Eco|first=Umberto|title=Reflections on The Name of the Rose|year=1985|publisher=Martin Secker & Warburg Limited|location=London|others=W. Weaver (trans.)|language=English}}</ref> There is a tribute to [[Jorge Luis Borges]], a major influence on Eco, in the blind monk and librarian Jorge of Burgos: Borges, like the character Jorge, lived a celibate life consecrated to his passion for books, and also went blind in later life. William of Baskerville is a logically-minded Englishman who is a friar and a detective, and his name evokes both [[William of Ockham]] and [[Sherlock Holmes]] (by way of ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles]]''); several passages describing him are strongly reminiscent of [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s descriptions of Holmes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Eco|first=Umberto|title=The Name of the Rose|year=1986|publisher=Warner Books|location=New York|isbn=0-446-34410-9|pages=10}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Doyle|first=Arthur Conan|title=Sherlock Holmes: The Complete Novels and Stories Vol 1|year=2003|publisher=Bantam Books|location=New York|isbn=0-553-21241-9|pages=11}}</ref> The underlying mystery of the murder is borrowed from the "[[Arabian Nights]]". ''The Name of the Rose'' was later made into [[The Name of the Rose (film)|a motion picture]] starring [[Sean Connery]], [[F. Murray Abraham]], [[Christian Slater]] and [[Ron Perlman]], which follows the plot, though not the philosophical and historical themes, of the novel.

In ''[[Foucault's Pendulum]]'' (1988), three under-employed editors who work for a minor publishing house decide to amuse themselves by inventing a conspiracy theory. Their conspiracy, which they call "The Plan", is about an immense and intricate plot to take over the world by a secret order descended from the [[Knights Templar]]. As the game goes on, the three slowly become obsessed with the details of this plan. The game turns dangerous when outsiders learn of The Plan, and believe that the men have really discovered the secret to regaining the lost treasure of the Templars.

''[[The Island of the Day Before]]'' (1994) was Eco's third novel. The book, set in the seventeenth century, is about a man [[marooning|marooned]] on a ship within sight of an island which he believes is on the other side of the international date-line. The main character is trapped by his inability to swim and instead spends the bulk of the book reminiscing on his life and the adventures that brought him to be marooned.

''[[Baudolino]]'' was published in 2000. Baudolino is a knight who saves the Byzantine historian [[Niketas Choniates]] during the sack of Constantinople in the [[Fourth Crusade]]. Claiming to be an accomplished liar, he confides his history, from his childhood as a peasant lad endowed with a vivid imagination, through his role as adopted son of [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick Barbarossa]], to his mission to visit the mythical realm of [[Prester John]]. Throughout his retelling, Baudolino brags of his ability to swindle and tell tall tales, leaving the historian (and the reader) unsure of just how much of his story was a lie.

''[[The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana]]'' (2005) is about Giambattista Bodoni, an old bookseller specializing in antiques who emerges from a coma with only some memories to recover his past. Bodoni is pressed to make a very difficult choice, one between his past and his future. He must either abandon his past to live his future or regain his past and sacrifice his future.

''[[The Prague Cemetery]]'', Eco's sixth novel, was published in 2010. It is the story of a secret agent who "weaves plots, conspiracies, intrigues and attacks, and helps determine the historical and political fate of the European Continent." The book is a narrative of the rise of Modern-day [[antisemitism]], by way of the [[Dreyfus affair]], ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' and other important 19th century events which gave rise to hatred and hostility toward the [[Jewish]] people.

''[[Numero Zero]]'' was published in 2015. Set in 1992 and narrated by Colonna, a hack journalist working on a Milan newspaper, it offers a satire of Italy's kickback and bribery culture<ref>Ian Thomson, Evening Standard, 12 November 2015.</ref> as well as, among many things, the legacy of [[Fascism]].
