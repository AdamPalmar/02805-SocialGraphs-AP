'''Christian Wolff''' (less correctly '''Wolf''', {{IPA-de|vɔlf|lang}}; also known as '''Wolfius'''; ennobled as '''Christian [[Freiherr]] von Wolff'''; 24 January 1679 – 9 April 1754) was a [[German philosophy|German philosopher]]. Wolff was the most eminent German philosopher between [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]].  His main achievement was a complete ''oeuvre'' on almost every scholarly subject of his time, displayed and unfolded according to his demonstrative-deductive, mathematical method, which perhaps represents the peak of [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] [[rationality]] in Germany.

Wolff was also the creator of German as the language of scholarly instruction and research, although he also wrote in [[Latin]], so that an international audience could, and did, read him.  A founding father of, among other fields, economics and [[public administration]] as academic disciplines, he concentrated especially in these fields, giving advice on practical matters to people in government, and stressing the professional nature of university education.

==Life==
[[File:Wolff-tablica.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Plaque on building in [[Wrocław]] (''Breslau'') where Wolff was born and lived, 1679–99]]

Wolff was born in [[Breslau]], [[Habsburg Silesia|Silesia]] (now [[Wrocław]], Poland), into a modest family. He studied mathematics and physics at the [[University of Jena]], soon adding philosophy. In 1703, he qualified as ''[[Privatdozent]]'' at [[Leipzig University]],<ref>His ''[[Habilitation]]'' thesis title was ''Philosophia practica universalis, methodo mathematica conscripta'' (''On Universal Practical Philosophy, Composed from the Mathematical Method'').</ref> where he lectured until 1706, when he was called as professor of mathematics and natural philosophy to the [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|University of Halle]]. By this time he had made the acquaintance of [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] (the two men engaged in an epistolary correspondence), of whose philosophy his own system is a modified version. At Halle, Wolff at first restricted himself to mathematics, but on the departure of a colleague, he added physics, and soon included all the main philosophical disciplines.

However, the claims Wolff advanced on behalf of [[rationalism|philosophical reason]] appeared impious to his theological colleagues. [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] was the headquarters of [[Pietism]], which, after a long struggle against [[Lutheran]] [[dogma]]tism, had assumed the characteristics of a new orthodoxy. Wolff's professed ideal was to base theological truths on mathematically certain evidence. Strife with the Pietists broke out openly in 1721, when Wolff, on the occasion of stepping down as pro-rector, delivered an oration "On the Practical Philosophy of the Chinese" (Eng. tr. 1750), in which he praised the purity of the moral precepts of [[Confucius]], pointing to them as an evidence of the power of human reason to reach moral truth by its own efforts.

On 12 July 1723 Wolff held a lecture for students and the magistrates at the end of his term as a rector.<ref name=wolfc>{{cite book|url=|last=Wolf|first=C.|editor=Michael Albrecht|title=Oratio de Sinarum philosophia practica/Rede über die praktische Philosophie der Chinesen|language=German|series=Philosophische Bibliothek|publisher=Felix Meiner Verlag|location=Hamburg, Germany|year=1985|page=XXXIX|isbn=}}</ref> Wolff compared, based on books by the Belgian missionaries [[François Noël (1651–1729)]] and [[Philippe Couplet]], Moses, Christ and Mohammed with Confucius.<ref name=jstor>{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |year=1953|volume=14|number=4|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|jstor=2707702|title=The Sinophilism of Christian Wolf (1679–1754)|last=Lang|first=Donald F.|page=561}}</ref> According to [[Voltaire]] professor [[August Hermann Francke]] had been teaching in an empty classroom but Wolff attracted with his lectures around 1,000 students from all over.<ref name=rathaus>{{cite web|url=http://www.rathausseite.de/default.asp?id=l2&b=09|title=Auditorium Maximum der Universität Halle|publisher=Rathausseite|language=German|accessdate=1 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130211184843/http://www.rathausseite.de/default.asp?id=l2&b=09|archivedate=11 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In the following up Wolff was accused by Francke of [[fatalism]] and atheism.<ref name=uhalley>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vEZI_ULqp7EC&pg=PA160&lpg=PA160&dq=Discourse+on+the+Practical+Philosophy+of+the+Chinese&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Discourse%20on%20the%20Practical%20Philosophy%20of%20the%20Chinese&f=false|last=Uhalley|first=Stephen|author2=Xiaoxin Wu|title=China and Christianity: Burdened Past, Hopeful Future|publisher=University of San Francisco Ricci Institute for Chinese-Western Cultural History|location=San Francisco|year=2001|page=160|isbn=0-7656-0661-5|accessdate=1 January 2012}}</ref>

As a consequence, Wolff was ousted in 1723 from his first chair at [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] in one of the most celebrated [[academic drama]]s of the 18th century. His successors were [[Joachim Lange]], a pietist, and his son. His enemies had gained the ear of the king [[Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia|Frederick William I]] and told him that, if Wolff's determinism were recognized, no soldier who deserted could be punished, since he would only have acted as it was necessarily predetermined that he should. This so enraged the king that he immediately deprived Wolff of his office, and commanded him to leave Prussian territory within 48 hours or be hanged. The same day Wolff passed into Saxony, and presently proceeded to [[Marburg]], [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]], to whose university (the [[University of Marburg]]) he had received a call even before this crisis, which was now renewed. The [[Landgraf|Landgrave]] of Hesse received him with every mark of distinction, and the circumstances of his expulsion drew universal attention to his philosophy. It was everywhere discussed, and over two hundred books and pamphlets appeared for or against it before 1737, not reckoning the systematic treatises of Wolff and his followers.

Israel]] "the conflict became one of the most significant cultural confrontations of the 18th century and perhaps the most important of the Enlightenment in Central Europe and the Baltic countries before the French Revolution."<ref name=israel>{{cite book|url=|last=Israel|first=Jonathan I.|title=Radical Enlightenment: Philosophy and the Making of Modernity|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|chapter=29|isbn=0-19-925456-7}}<!--|accessdate=1 January 2012--></ref> 
In 1726 Wolff published his Discours, in which he again mentioned the importance of listening to music put on pregnant Chinese women{{refn|group=note|What happened in Halle should not be seen as an isolated case, but as trendy and fashionable.

At the [[University of Marburg]], as one of the most popular and fashionable university teachers in Europe, he increased matriculation figures within five years by about 50%.

The Prussian crown prince Frederick defended Wolff against [[Joachim Lange]] and ordered the Berlin minister Jean Deschamps, a former pupil of Wolff, to translate ''Vernünftige Gedanken von Gott, der Welt und der Seele des Menschen, auch allen Dingen überhaupt'' into French.<ref>The Sciences of the Soul: The Early Modern Origins of Psychology

His entry into the town on 6 December 1740 took on the character of a triumphal procession. In 1743, he became chancellor of the university, and in 1745, he received the title of ''Freiherr'' ([[Baron]]) from the Elector of [[Bavaria]]. But his matter was no longer fashionable, he had outlived his power of attracting students, and his class-rooms remained, while not empty, then certainly emptier than they had been during his heyday in Marburg.

When Wolff died on 9 April 1754, he was a very wealthy man, almost entirely due to his income from lecture-fees, salaries, and royalties.  He was also a member of many academies and probably the first scholar to have been created hereditary [[Baron]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] on the basis of his academic work.  His school, the Wolffians, was the first school, in the philosophical sense, associated with a German philosopher.  It dominated Germany until the rise of [[Immanuel Kant|Kantianism]].

==Philosophy==
{{unreferenced|section|date=April 2017}}
[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]]]

Christian Wolff redefined philosophy as the science of the possible, and applied it in a comprehensive survey of human knowledge to the disciplines of his time.  Wolffian philosophy has a marked insistence everywhere on a clear and methodic exposition, holding confidence in the power of reason to reduce all subjects to this form. He was distinguished for writing copies in both Latin and German. Wolff's teachings held virtually undisputed sway in Germany till the [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] revolution, and even after that, Wolff continued to be regarded as one of the most important philosophers from German-speaking lands.

Until the 1960s, it was usually maintained by historians that Wolff's philosophy amounted to a common-sense adaptation or watering-down of the [[Leibnizian]] system; or, more charitably, Wolff was said to have methodized and "reduced" to dogmatic form the thoughts of his great predecessor. The Wolffian system retains the determinism and optimism of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], but the [[monadology]] recedes into the background, the monads falling asunder into souls or conscious beings on the one hand and mere atoms on the other. The doctrine of the pre-established harmony also loses its metaphysical significance (while remaining an important [[heuristic]] device), and the [[principle of sufficient reason]]  is once more discarded in favor of the [[principle of contradiction]] which Wolff seeks to make the fundamental principle of philosophy.

Wolff had philosophy divided into a theoretical and a practical part. Logic, sometimes called ''philosophia rationalis'', forms the introduction or [[propaedeutics]] to both. Theoretical philosophy had for its parts [[ontology]] or ''philosophia prima'', [[Cosmology (philosophy)|cosmology]], rational psychology, and natural theology; ontology treats of the existent in general, cosmology of the world as a whole, psychology of the soul as a simple non-extended substance, and [[rational theology]] of the existence and attributes of God. These are best known to philosophical students by Kant's treatment of them in the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''. Practical philosophy is subdivided into ethics, economics and politics. Wolff's moral principle is the realization of human perfection{{mdash}}seen realistically as the kind of perfection the human person actually can achieve in the world in which we live. It is perhaps the combination of Enlightenment optimism and worldly realism that made Wolff so successful and popular as a teacher of future statesmen and business leaders.

==Works==
Wolff's most important works are as follows:
*''Dissertatio algebraica de algorithmo infinitesimali differentiali'' (''Dissertation on the Algebra of Solving Differential Equations Using Infinitesimals''; 1704)<ref>Available online on [http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/dms/load/img/?PID=PPN599485728 Göttinger Digitalisierungszentrum].</ref>

*''Vernünftige Gedanken von den Kräften des menschlichen Verstandes'' (1712). French translation by Jean Des Champs, ''Logique'', Berlin: 1736. English translation by anonymous, ''Logic'', London: 1770.

*''Vern. Ged. von Gott, der Welt und der Seele des Menschen, auch allen Dingen überhaupt'' (1719)
*''Vern. Ged. von der Menschen Thun und Lassen'' (1720)

*''Vern. Ged. von den Wirkungen der Natur'' (1723)
*''Vern. Ged. von den Absichten der natürlichen Dinge'' (1724)
*''Vern. Ged. von dem Gebrauche der Theile in Menschen, Thieren und Pflanzen'' (1725); the last seven may briefly be described as treatises on [[logic]], [[metaphysics]], moral philosophy, political philosophy, theoretical physics, [[teleology]], [[physiology]]
*''Philosophia rationalis, sive logica'' (1728)
*''Philosophia prima, sive Ontologia'' (1730)
*''Cosmologia generalis'' (1731)
*''Psychologia empirica'' (1732)
*''Psychologia rationalis'' (1734)
*''Theologia naturalis'' (1736–1737)
*''Kleine philosophische Schriften'', collected and edited by G.F. Hagen (1736–1740).
*''Philosophia practica universalis'' (1738–1739)
*''Jus naturae and Jus Gentium'' (1740–1749)
*''Jus Gentium Methodo Scientifica Pertractum'' (The Law of Nations According to the Scientific Method) (1749)
*''Philosophia moralis'' (1750–1753).
Wolff's complete writings have been published since 1962 in an annotated reprint collection:
*''Gesammelte Werke'',  Jean École et al. (eds.), 3 series (German, Latin, and Materials), Hildesheim-[Zürich-]New York: Olms, 1962–.
This includes a volume that unites the three most important older biographies of Wolff.

An excellent modern edition of the famous Halle speech on Chinese philosophy is:
