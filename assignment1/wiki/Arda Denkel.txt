'''Arda Denkel''' (1949–2000) was a Turkish philosopher. He studied at the [[University of Oxford]]  and, under [[Peter Strawson]], wrote his D. Phil. dissertation which he later developed into a more expansive study with his book [[The Natural Background of Meaning]] in 1999.

Upon his return to [[Turkey]] he became an important promoter of [[analytical philosophy]] in Turkey, a country traditionally almost entirely cultivated within a continental atmosphere, and became a faculty member in the philosophy department at the [[Bogazici University]] in [[Istanbul]] for the rest of his life.

He was twice a visiting professor at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin]] between 1985 and 1989, and served as a member of the steering committee of the [[European Society for Analytic Philosophy]] (ESAP) between 1996 and 1999.

He also authored several other books and articles in both Turkish and English, including his [[Object and Property]] in 1996. He died in 2000 after a prolonged fight with a brain tumour.
