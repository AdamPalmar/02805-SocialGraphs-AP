==Research areas and publications==
Her research has focused largely on metaphysics and epistemology, with a focus on the metaphysics of [[modal logic|modality]], fundamentality, science, and mind, and the epistemologies of skepticism, a priori deliberation, and necessity, as well as [[physicalism]], [[emergentism]], and [[mental causation]].<ref name=bio/> In the study of [[physicalism]], Wilson first published on the 'proper subset strategy' for avoiding the worry that higher-level and their realizing lower-level properties would [[causally]] [[overdetermination|overdetermine]] their effects: [[properties]] are associated with sets of [[causal powers]], and one property realizes another by the realized property being associated with a set of causal powers that is a proper [[subset]] of that associated with the realizing property;<ref name=pss>[http://philpapers.org/rec/WILHSD 'How superduper does a physicalist supervenience need to be?']</ref> Wilson also argues that a nontrivial version of [[physicalism]] must be defined to exclude fundamental mental entities.<ref name=phys1>{{cite book|last=Pereboom|first=Derk|title=Consciousness and the prospects of physicalism|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0199764037}}</ref> Wilson's criticism of  'Grounding', understood as a generic relation of metaphysical dependence, problematizes a notion that has recently occupied center stage in metaphysics.<ref name=grd>[https://philpapers.org/rec/WILTMO-16 'No work for a theory of grounding']</ref>
