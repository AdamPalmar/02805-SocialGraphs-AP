'''Robert Anthony "Bob" Kowalski''' (born 15 May 1941) is a [[logician]] and [[computer scientist]], who has spent most of his career in the United Kingdom.

==Early life and education==
He was educated at the [[University of Chicago]], [[University of Bridgeport]] (BA in mathematics, 1963), [[Stanford University]] (MSc in mathematics, 1966), [[University of Warsaw]] and the [[University of Edinburgh]] (PhD in [[computer science]], 1970). 

==Career==
He was a [[research fellow]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]] (1970–75) and has been at [[Imperial College London]] since 1975, attaining a chair in [[Computational logic]] in 1982 and becoming Emeritus Professor in 1999. He was inducted as a Fellow of the [[American Association for Artificial Intelligence]] in 1991, of the European Co-ordinating Committee for Artificial Intelligence in 1999, and the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] in 2001.

He began his research in the field of [[automated theorem proving]], developing both SL-resolution<ref>Kowalski, R. and Kuehner, D., "Linear Resolution with Selection Function", in Artificial Intelligence, Vol. 2, 1971, pp. 227–260. Reprinted in ''Anthology of Automated Theorem-Proving Papers'', Vol. 2, [[Springer-Verlag]], 1983, pp. 542–577.</ref> with Donald Kuehner and the connection graph proof procedure.<ref>Kowalski, R., "A Proof Procedure Using Connection Graphs", in ''[[Journal of the ACM]]'' Vol. 22, No. 4, 1975, pp. 572–595.</ref> However, he is best known for his contributions to the development of [[logic programming]], starting with the procedural interpretation of [[Horn clauses]].<ref>Kowalski, R., "Predicate Logic as Programming Language", in Proceedings IFIP Congress, Stockholm, North Holland Publishing Co., 1974, pp. 569–574. Reprinted in Computers for Artificial Intelligence Applications, (eds. Wah, B. and Li, G.-J.), [[IEEE Computer Society Press]], Los Angeles, 1986, pp. 68–73.</ref> 

He also developed the minimal model and the fixpoint semantics of Horn clauses with Maarten van Emden.<ref>van Emden, M. and Kowalski, R., "The Semantics of Predicate Logic as a Programming Language", in ''Journal of the ACM'', Vol. 23, No. 4, 1976, pp. 733–742.</ref> With Marek Sergot, he developed both the [[event calculus]]<ref>Kowalski, R. and Sergot, M., "A Logic-based Calculus of Events", in ''[[New Generation Computing]]'', Vol. 4, No. 1, February 1986, pp. 67–95. Also in ''Knowledge Base Management-Systems'', (eds. C. Thanos and J. W. Schmidt), Springer-Verlag, pp. 23–51. Also in The Language of Time: A Reader (eds. Inderjeet Mani, J. Pustejovsky, and R. Gaizauskas). [[Oxford University Press]], 2005.</ref> and the application of logic programming to legal reasoning.<ref>Sergot, M., Sadri, F., Kowalski, R., Kriwaczek, F., Hammond, P., and Cory, T., "The British Nationality Act as a Logic Program", in ''[[Communications of the ACM]]'', Vol. 29, No. 5, 1986, pp. 370–386.</ref><ref>Kowalski, R., "Legislation as Logic Programs", in Logic Programming in Action (eds. G. Comyn, N. E. Fuchs, M. J. Ratcliffe), Springer-Verlag, 1992, pp. 203–230.</ref> With Fariba Sadri, he developed an agent model<ref>Kowalski, R., "Using Metalogic to Reconcile Reactive with Rational Agents". In ''Meta-Logics and Logic Programming'' (K. Apt and F. Turini, eds.), [[MIT Press]], 1995.</ref><ref>Kowalski, R. and Sadri, F., "From Logic Programming towards Multi-agent Systems", ''[[Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence]]'', Volume 25 (1999), pp. 391–419.</ref> in which beliefs are represented by logic programs and goals are represented by [[integrity constraints]]. 

Kowalski was one of the early developers of [[Abductive Logic Programming]], in which logic programs are augmented with integrity constraints and with undefined, abducible predicates.<ref>Eshghi, K.,and Kowalski, R., "Abduction through deduction". Department of Computing, Imperial College, 1988.</ref><ref>Kakas, T., Kowalski, K. and Toni, F., "Abductive Logic Programming". ''[[Journal of Logic and Computation]]'', 1992, Vol. 2 No. 6, pp. 719–770.</ref> This work led to the demonstration with Phan Minh Dung and Francesca Toni that most logics for default reasoning can be regarded as special cases of assumption-based [[argumentation]].<ref>Bondarenko, A., Dung, P. M., Kowalski, R., and Toni, F. " An Abstract Argumentation-theoretic Approach to Default Reasoning". ''[[Journal of Artificial Intelligence]]'', 93(1–2), 1997, pp 63–101.</ref><ref>Dung, P. M., Kowalski, R., and Toni, F. "Dialectic proof procedures for assumption-based, admissible argumentation". ''Journal of Artificial Intelligence'', 170(2), February 2006, pp. 114–159.</ref>
