'''Mojżesz Presburger''' (1904–1943?) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[Jew]]ish [[mathematician]], [[logician]], and [[philosopher]]. He was a student of [[Alfred Tarski]] and is known for, among other things, having invented [[Presburger arithmetic]] as a student in 1929.<ref>{{cite book | author=M.

In 2010, the [[European Association for Theoretical Computer Science]] began conferring the annual '''[[Presburger Award]]''' (named after Mojżesz Presburger) to a young scientist (in exceptional cases to several young scientists) for outstanding contributions in theoretical computer science.  [[Mikołaj Bojańczyk]] was the first recipient.
