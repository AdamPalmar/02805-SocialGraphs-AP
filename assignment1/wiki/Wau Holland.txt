'''Herwart Holland-Moritz''', known as '''Wau Holland''', (20 December 1951 &ndash; 29 July 2001) was a German computer security activist and journalist who in 1981 cofounded the [[Chaos Computer Club]] (CCC), one of the world's oldest [[hack (technology slang)|hacking]] clubs. 

== Career ==
In 1981, Holland cofounded the Chaos Computer Club. The CCC became world-famous when its members exposed security flaws in [[Germany]]'s "[[Bildschirmtext]]" (Btx) online television service by getting a bank to send them [[German mark|DM]] 134,000 for accessing its Btx page many times. They returned the money the following day.

From 1983 he was a columnist for the Berlin-based ''[[Die Tageszeitung]]'', often reporting on the [[Bulletin board system|BBS scene]] and the computer underground.

Holland also co-founded the CCC's hacker magazine ''[[Datenschleuder]]'' in 1984, which praised the possibilities of global information networks and powerful [[computer]]s, and included detailed [[Electrical wiring|wiring]] diagrams for building [[modem]]s cheaply. The then-monopolist telephone company of Germany's [[Deutsche Bundespost]] had to approve modems and sold expensive, slow modems of their own. The telecommunications branch of Deutsche Bundespost was privatized and is now [[Deutsche Telekom]].

Because of Holland's continuing participation in the club, the CCC gained popularity and credibility. He gave speeches on information control for the government and the private sector. Holland fought against [[copy protection]] and all forms of [[censorship]] and for an open information infrastructure. He compared the censorship demands by some governments to those of the [[Christian]] church in the [[Middle Ages]] and regarded copy protection as a [[product defect]]. In his last years, he spent a lot of his time at a youth centre teaching children both the ethics and the technology of hacking.<ref name="tp9195">[http://www.heise.de/tp/r4/artikel/9/9195/1.html Hacken als Form der Gesellschaftskritik] - Telepolis</ref>

== Personal life ==
Holland was born in [[Kassel]], and grew up in [[Marburg]], [[Hesse]]. He graduated from the [[Gymnasium Philippinum]] secondary school and attended the [[University of Marburg]], though he did not graduate.<ref>[https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?act=url&depth=1&hl=en&ie=UTF8&prev=_t&rurl=translate.google.com&sl=auto&tl=en&u=http://planatscher.net/wau/wau.html&usg=ALkJrhi_CmMynvDyMXk1cDO29S-oOYI9fg http://planatscher.net/wau/wau.html]</ref> 

Holland was an [[amateur radio operator]] and held the [[call sign]] DB4FA.<ref>[http://www.ccc.de/de/updates/2003/funkamateure-d23 Funkamateure im CCC jetzt auch im DARC] - Chaos Computer Club</ref>
