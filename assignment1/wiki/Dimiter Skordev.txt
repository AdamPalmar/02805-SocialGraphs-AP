'''Dimiter Skordev''' ({{lang-bg|Димитър Скордев}}) (born 1936 in [[Sofia]]) is a professor in the Department of Mathematical Logic and Applications, Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science at the [[St. Kliment Ohridski]] [[University of Sofia]].  Chairman of the department in 1972-2000.  Doyen and pioneer of [[mathematical logic]] research in [[Bulgaria]] who developed a Bulgarian school in the theory of computability, namely the algebraic (or axiomatic) recursion theory. He was the 1981 winner of ''Acad. Nikola Obreshkov Prize'', the highest Bulgarian award in mathematics, bestowed for his monograph ''Combinatory Spaces and Recursiveness in Them''.<ref>A. Soskova, L. Ivanov and I. Georgiev.

Skordev's field of scientific interests include [[recursion theory|computability]] and [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]] in [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], [[mathematical logic]], generalized [[recursion theory]], and theory of [[computer programs|programs]] and [[theory of computation|computation]].

Skordev has more than 45 years of lecturing experience in [[calculus]], [[mathematical logic]], [[logic programming]], [[discrete mathematics]], and [[computer science]].  He authored about 90 scientific publications including two monographs, and was one of the authors of the new Bulgarian [[phonetics|phonetic]] [[keyboard layout#Bulgarian|keyboard layout]] proposed (but rejected) to become a state [[Standardization|standard]] in 2006.
