'''Richard Meltzer''' (born May 10, 1945, New York City) is a [[music critic|rock critic]], performer and writer.  He is considered by some rock historians to be the first to write real analysis of rock and roll and is credited with inventing "rock criticism".<ref name="Writer Richard Meltzer">{{cite news|url=http://www.opb.org/television/programs/artbeat/segment/writer-richard-meltzer/|publisher=''Oregon Public Broadcasting''|title=Writer Richard Meltzer|date=September 30, 2004|accessdate=April 10, 2016}}</ref>

==Biography==
Meltzer claims that as a young man he was influenced by the [[pop art]]ists [[Jasper Johns]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and by the artists [[Paul Cezanne]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWDTRT3YhAk&nohtml5=False |title=Richard Meltzer Talks About Art, Artists and Life|date=6 April 2016 |website=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=10 April 2016}}</ref> Meltzer's first book, ''[[The Aesthetics of Rock]]'', evolved out of his undergraduate studies in philosophy at [[Stony Brook University]] and graduate studies at [[Yale University]]. At school, he developed a reputation as something of a prankster, although his actions were closer to the spirit of performance art happenings promoted by one of his professors, [[Allan Kaprow]], than to fraternity hijinks.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} One of his actions involved sending a tape recorder to class with his comments for the day on tape. Fellow student [[Sandy Pearlman]] was responsible for pushing the button.<!--[from W.F. a fellow student in the Philosophy Department] -- William enjoys telling this story.--> Meltzer also dabbled in art, including "detourned" comic books in the style of the [[Situationist International|situationists]], which had various objects added to the pages.

Meltzer, along with Pearlman and several other students, earned money on the side as booking agents for the big musical acts that came to Stony Brook in the 1960s. Following that, the two started writing lyrics and arranging gigs for a musical group they were promoting, Soft White Underbelly, later renamed [[Blue Öyster Cult]] (BÖC). Meltzer wrote the lyrics for many of the band's songs, including the hit "[[Burnin' for You]]".

BÖC guitarist and keyboardist [[Allen Lanier]] is often credited with coming up with the [[metal umlaut|umlaut]] over the O, but Meltzer claims to have suggested it to producer and manager Pearlman just after Pearlman came up with the name: "I said, 'How about an umlaut over the O?' Metal had a [[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]] aspect anyway."

Meltzer started his career in 1967 writing for [[Paul Williams (Crawdaddy! creator)|Paul Williams]]'s ''[[Crawdaddy!]]'' magazine. That year, he also taught a class in [[aesthetics]] at the [[Maryland Institute College of Art]]. He went on to write for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', the ''[[Village Voice]]'' and ''[[Creem]]''.

During the punk rock era, he formed a band called [[VOM (punk rock band)|VOM]] (short for ''vomi'') and released a four-song, 7-inch EP that included "Electrocute Your Cock". Meltzer also produced a movie, directed by Richard Casey, who later directed several Blue Öyster Cult videos. Clips were filmed in Casey's apartment; in [[Malibu, California]]; at the Pike in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]]; and at a beach-side sewage treatment plant in [[El Segundo, California|El Segundo]], with future [[Mau Maus]] guitarist [[Mike R. Livingston]] pantomiming rhythm guitar along with Gregg Turner and bonze blayk (known at that time as Kevin Saunders), who were then organizing the [[Angry Samoans]] with [[Mike Saunders]], the drummer for VOM. The film for "Electrocute Your Cock" shows Meltzer in the shower, clad in a T-shirt reading"Halifax, NS", with jumper cables attached to his crotch and sparks hand-drawn onto the film cels simulating electrocution. Also included was a beach-side clip for "Punkmobile." The videos are included in the Angry Samoans' 1995 VHS compilation, ''True Documentary''.<ref name=truedoc>Angry Samoans (1995).

In the 1980s, Meltzer dabbled in architectural criticism, writing a series of articles for the ''[[L.A. Reader]]'' alternative weekly on the ugliest buildings in Los Angeles; these pieces were later published as a book.  He moved to [[Portland, Oregon]] in the 1990s, but continued contributing to the ''[[San Diego Reader]]''. He was also a regular columnist for ''[[Addicted to Noise]]'', and by 2004 he was a contributor to a new weekly, ''[[Los Angeles CityBeat]]''.

In 2002 he released the CD ''Tropic of Nipples'' along with [[Smegma (band)|Smegma]], [[VOM (punk rock band)|VOM]], Antler and [[Robert Pollard]] of [[Guided by Voices]].

He has also performed and recorded over the past decade with the improvisational music group [[Smegma (band)|Smegma]].

In 2012, Meltzer contributed spoken-word parts to ''[[Spielgusher]]'', a musical collaboration with bassist [[Mike Watt]], drummer [[Yuko Araki]] and guitarist [[Hirotaka Shimizu]].  Meltzer and Watt had originally hoped to collaborate during Watt's time in [[The Minutemen (band)|The Minutemen]], but it was not completed before the death of Minutemen guitarist [[D. Boon]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/music/index.ssf/2012/01/rock_critic_richard_meltzer_an.html |title=Rock critic Richard Meltzer and punk bassist Mike Watt collaborate on project |last=Friedman |first=Kevin |date=January 12, 2012 |website=oregonlive.com |publisher=The Oregonian |access-date=November 18, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2012/jun/06/musician-interview-richard-meltzer/# |title=Richard Meltzer's New Gig |last=Hamlin |first=Andrew |date=June 6, 2012 |website=sandiegoreader.com |publisher=The San Diego Reader |access-date=November 18, 2016}}</ref>
