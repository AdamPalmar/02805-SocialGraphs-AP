==Philosophy==
Veatch was a major proponent of [[rationalism]], an authority on [[Thomism|Thomistic philosophy]], and one of the leading neo-[[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] thinkers of his time.  He opposed such modern and contemporary developments as the "[[transcendental idealism|transcendental turn]]" and the "[[linguistic turn]]."  A staunch advocate of plain speaking and "[[Hoosier]]" common sense, in philosophy and elsewhere, he argued on behalf of [[philosophical realism|realist]] [[metaphysics]] and practical [[ethics]].<ref>Rocco Porecco and Ronald Duska, "Memorial Minutes: Henry Veatch 1911&ndash;1999," ''Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association'', vol. 73, no. 2 (Nov/1999), pp. 31&ndash;2.</ref>

Veatch's most widely read book was ''Rational Man: A Modern Interpretation of Aristotelian Ethics'' (1962) which explicitly offered a rationalist counterpoint to [[William Barrett (philosopher)|William Barrett's]] well-known study in [[existentialism|existential philosophy]], ''[[Irrational Man]]'' (1958).
