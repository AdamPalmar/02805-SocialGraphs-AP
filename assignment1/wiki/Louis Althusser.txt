{{Marxism}}

'''Louis Pierre Althusser''' ({{IPA-fr|altysɛʁ|lang}}; 16 October 1918 – 22 October 1990) was a French [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist philosopher]]. He was born in [[Algeria]] and studied at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in Paris, where he eventually became Professor of Philosophy.

Althusser was a longtime member—although sometimes a strong critic—of the [[French Communist Party]]. His arguments and theses were set against the threats that he saw attacking the theoretical foundations of Marxism. These included both the influence of [[empiricism]] on [[Marxist]] theory, and humanist and reformist socialist orientations which manifested as divisions in the European communist parties, as well as the problem of the "[[cult of personality]]" and of ideology.

Althusser is commonly referred to as a [[Structural Marxism|structural Marxist]], although his relationship to other schools of French [[structuralism]] is not a simple affiliation and he was critical of many aspects of structuralism.

Althusser's life was marked by periods of intense mental illness. In 1980, he killed his wife, the sociologist [[Hélène Rytmann]], by strangling her. He was declared unfit to stand trial due to insanity, and was committed to a psychiatric hospital for three years. He did little further academic work, dying in 1990.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kaplan|first1=Alice|title=Book Review: A Living Death: The Future Last Forever: A Memoir, By Louis Althusser|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-03-13/books/bk-33244_1_louis-althusser|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=20 November 2014|date=13 March 1994}}</ref>

==Biography==

===Early life===
Althusser was born in [[French Algeria]] in the town of [[Birmendreïs]], near [[Algiers]], to a ''[[pieds-noirs]]'' family.<ref name="stanford1"/> He was named after his paternal uncle who had been killed in the [[First World War]]. Althusser wrote later that his mother had intended to marry his uncle, and married his father only because of the brother's death. Althusser later alleged that his mother treated him as a substitute for his deceased uncle, to which he attributed deep psychological damage.

Following the death of his father, Althusser moved from [[Algiers]] with his mother and younger sister to [[Marseille]], where he spent the rest of his childhood. He joined the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] youth movement Jeunesse Étudiante Chrétienne in 1937.<ref name="stanford1"/> Althusser was a brilliant student at the [[Lycée du Parc]] in [[Lyon]] and was later (in 1939) accepted by the elite [[École Normale Supérieure]] (ENS) in Paris.<ref name="stanford1"/> His attendance however was deferred by six years,<ref>R. Jon McGee, Richard L. Warms (eds.), ''Theory in Social and Cultural Anthropology: An Encyclopedia'', SAGE Publications, 2013, p. 7.</ref> because he was drafted in the run-up to [[World War II]] and, like most French soldiers following the [[Fall of France]], was interned in a German [[prisoner of war]] camp. There, Althusser began the thinking that took him toward [[Communism]]. He was held in the camp for the rest of the war, under conditions that contributed to his lifelong bouts of mental instability.<ref name="stanford1"/>

===Health===
Returning from the war, he was in poor health, both mentally and physically. In 1947 he was hospitalized for the first time for [[Bipolar I disorder|manic-depressive psychosis]]<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Kirshner|first=Lewis A.|year=2003|title=The Man Who Didn't Exist: The Case of Louis Althusser|url=https://www.academia.edu/524253/The_Man_Who_Didnt_Exist_the_Case_of_Louis_Althusser|journal=American Imago|volume=60|issue=2|pages=211-239|via=}}</ref> and received [[electroconvulsive therapy]]. 

Althusser would from this point suffer from periodic mental illness for the rest of his life and was repeatedly hospitalized. In about 1950 he received [[narcotherapy]] and from 1964 to 1980 he was treated by the psychiatrist and psychonanalyst René Diatkine.<ref name=":0" /> 

===Early years at ENS===
After the war, Althusser was able to finally attend the [[École Normale Supérieure]] (ENS) in Paris.<ref name="stanford1" /> The school was sympathetic with his illness, allowing him to reside in his own room in the school infirmary. Althusser would live at the ENS in the Rue d'Ulm for decades, except for periods of hospitalization. His professional role within the school structure was ill-defined, leading to his nickname amongst the students ''Althusserarien'' ("Althusser good for nothing").

In 1946, Althusser met [[Hélène Rytman]], a revolutionary of [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian Jewish]] origin. Hélène had been involved with the French resistance and had been a member of the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF), but the party expelled her.<ref name=":0" /> Althusser and Rytman began a life-long relationship.<ref name="stanford1" /> 

Althusser obtained his ''{{Interlanguage link multi|diplôme d'études supérieures|fr}}'' (roughly equivalent to an [[Master of Arts|MA]] thesis) in 1947 for a work directed by [[Gaston Bachelard]] and titled "On Content in the Thought of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]]"<ref name="stanford1"/> ("Du contenu dans la pensée de G. W. F. Hegel").

Formerly a devout if [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] Catholic, Althusser joined the French Communist Party in 1948,<ref name="stanford1"/> a time when others such as [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] were losing sympathy for the party. That same year, Althusser passed the ''[[agrégation]]'' in philosophy.<ref name="stanford1"/>

===De-Stalinisation===
With the [[Twentieth Party Congress]] in 1956, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] began the process of "[[de-Stalinisation]]". For many Marxists — including the PCF's leading theoretician [[Roger Garaudy]] and the pre-eminent [[existentialist]] [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] — this meant the recovery of the [[Humanism|humanist]] roots of [[Karl Marx|Marx's]] thought, and the opening of a dialogue between Marxists and moderate socialists, existentialists, and Christians.<ref>Poster, M. (1975). ''Existential Marxism in Postwar France'', 340. Princeton, {{ISBN|0-691-07212-4}}. Available online here [http://www.humanities.uci.edu/mposter/EM/]</ref> However, Althusser opposed this trend, proffering a "theoretical [[anti-humanism]]" and sympathising with the criticisms by the [[Communist Party of China]], albeit cautiously. He was careful not to identify with [[Maoism]]. His stance during this period earned him notoriety within the PCF, and he was attacked by its [[secretary-general]] [[Waldeck Rochet]]. As a [[philosopher]] he trod another path, which later led him to "aleatory materialism"; yet he defended Marxist orthodox thought in relation to his own position and work, such as in his 1973 reply to [[John Lewis (philosopher)|John Lewis]].

Despite the involvement of many of his students in [[May 1968 events in France|the protests of May 1968]], Althusser initially greeted these developments with silence.<ref name="stanford1"/> Later, he expressed an opinion similar to the official PCF line, describing the students as victim to "infantile" [[Left-wing politics|leftism]]. As a result, Althusser was attacked by many former supporters.<ref name="stanford1"/> In response to these criticisms, he revised some of his positions, claiming that his earlier writings contained mistakes, and his later works saw a significant shift in emphasis.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

===1980s===
In 1980, Althusser's therapist Diatkine, who by now was also treating Althusser's wife Hélène, recommended that Althusser be hospitalized, but the couple refused. On the morning of 16 November 1980, Althusser emerged from their flat at ENS in a confused state, claiming that he had killed his wife. She was found strangled in the apartment. Althusser was sent to a psychiatric hospital and was declared to suffer from [[diminished responsibility]]. He was not tried, but instead committed to the Sainte-Anne psychiatric hospital, where he remained until 1983.<ref name=":0" />

Upon release, he moved to northern Paris and lived reclusively, seeing few people. He continued to work and write, but published little. In his autobiography, ''L'Avenir dure longtemps,''<ref name="stanford1"/> written in 1985 and published posthumously, he describes the events leading to the killing of his wife in detail.<ref name="Adair">{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/getting-away-with-murder-its-the-talk-of-paris--how-louis-althusser-killed-his-wife-how-he-was-an-intellectual-fraud-its-all-in-his-posthumous-autobiographical-memoir-gilbert-adair-turns-the-pages-1530755.html|title=Getting Away with Murder|last=Adair|first=Gilbert|work=The Independent|accessdate=14 April 2014}}</ref> 

He died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on 22 October 1990 at the age of 72. Much of his post-1980 work has been published posthumously.

==Thought==
{{Primary sources|section|date=February 2017}}
Althusser's earlier works include the influential volume ''[[Reading Capital]]'' (1965), which collects the work of Althusser and his students in an intensive philosophical rereading of [[Karl Marx]]'s ''[[Das Kapital|Capital]]''. The book reflects on the philosophical status of Marxist theory as "critique of political economy", and on its object. The original English translation of this work includes only the essays of Althusser and [[Étienne Balibar]],<ref>Althusser L., and Balibar E. (1965). ''Reading Capital'', translated by Ben Brewster, New Left Books, {{ISBN|0-902308-56-4}}. Available online here [http://www.marx2mao.com/Other/RC68NB.html]</ref> while the original French edition contains additional contributions from [[Jacques Rancière]], [[Pierre Macherey]], and [[Roger Establet]]. A full translation was published in 2016.

Several of Althusser's theoretical positions have remained influential in [[Marxist philosophy]]. The introduction to his collection ''[[For Marx]]'' proposes a great "epistemological break" between Marx's early writings (1840–45) and his later, properly [[Marxist]] texts,<ref>Althusser, L. (1969), ''For Marx'', translated by Ben Brewster, 33–34, Verso. {{ISBN|1-84467-052-X}}. Available online here [http://www.marx2mao.com/Other/FM65NB.html]</ref> borrowing a term from the [[philosopher of science]] [[Gaston Bachelard]].<ref>Althusser, L., ''For Marx'', 32</ref> His essay "Marxism and Humanism" is a strong statement of [[anti-humanism]] in Marxist theory, condemning ideas like "human potential" and "[[species-being]]", which are often put forth by Marxists, as outgrowths of a [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] ideology of "humanity".<ref>Althusser, L. (1969), "Marxism and Humanism" in ''For Marx'', pp. 219–48.</ref> His essay "Contradiction and Overdetermination" borrows the concept of [[overdetermination]] from [[psychoanalysis]], in order to replace the idea of "contradiction" with a more complex model of multiple [[causality]] in political situations<ref>Althusser, L. (1969), "Contradiction and Overdetermination" in ''For Marx'', pp. 87–128. {{ISBN|1-84467-052-X}}.</ref> (an idea closely related to [[Antonio Gramsci]]'s concept of [[cultural hegemony]].)<ref>Althusser, L., "Contradiction and Overdetermination" in ''For Marx'', 114</ref>

Althusser is also widely known as a theorist of [[ideology]]. His best-known essay, "[[Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses|Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses: Notes Toward an Investigation]]",<ref>Althusser, L. (1970), "Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses" in ''Lenin and Philosophy and other Essays'' (1971), translated by Ben Brewster, pp. 121–76. {{ISBN|0-902308-89-0}}. Available online here [http://www.marx2mao.com/Other/LPOE70ii.html] and here [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/althusser/1970/ideology.htm]</ref> establishes the concept of ideology. Althusser's theory of ideology draws on Marx and Gramsci, but also on [[Sigmund Freud|Freud's]] and [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan's]] psychological concepts of the unconscious and mirror-phase respectively, and describes the structures and systems that enable the concept of self. For Althusser, these structures are both agents of repression and inevitable: it is impossible to escape ideology and avoid being subjected to it. On the other hand, the collection of essays from which "Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses" is drawn<ref>Althusser, L. (1995) ''Sur la reproduction'', Presses Universitaires de France. {{ISBN|9782130473725}}</ref> contains other essays which confirm that Althusser's concept of ideology is broadly consistent with the classic Marxist theory of [[class struggle]].

Althusser's thought evolved during his lifetime. It has been the subject of argument and debate, especially within Marxism and specifically concerning his theory of knowledge (epistemology).

===Epistemological break===
Althusser argued that [[Karl Marx|Marx's]] thought was fundamentally misunderstood and underestimated. He fiercely condemned various interpretations of Marx's works—[[historicism]],<ref>Althusser, L. and Balibar, E. (1970), ''Reading Capital'', pp. 119–45. {{ISBN|0-902308-56-4}}.</ref> [[idealism]], and [[economic determinism|economism]]—on grounds that they fail to realise that with the "science of history", [[historical materialism]], Marx has constructed a revolutionary view of social change. These errors, he believes, result from the notion that Marx's entire body of work can be understood as a coherent whole. Rather, Althusser holds, Marx's thought contains a radical "epistemological break". Although the works of the [[young Marx]] are bound by the categories of German [[philosophy]] and classical [[political economy]], ''[[The German Ideology]]'' (written in 1845) makes a sudden and unprecedented departure.<ref>Althusser, L. "Elements of Self-Criticism" (1974) in ''Essays in Self-Criticism'' (1976), translated by Grahame Lock, pp. 101–62, 107. New Left Books. {{ISBN|0-902308-87-4}}. Available online here [http://www.marx2mao.com/Other/ESC76NB.html].</ref> This "break" represents a shift in Marx's work to a fundamentally different "problematic", i.e., a different set of central propositions and questions posed, a different theoretical framework.<ref>Althusser, L. and Balibar, E. (1970), ''Reading Capital'', 25–28. {{ISBN|0-902308-56-4}}.</ref> Althusser believes that Marx himself did not fully comprehend the significance of his own work, and was able to express it only obliquely and tentatively. The shift can be revealed only by a careful and sensitive "symptomatic reading".<ref>Althusser, L. and Balibar, E. (1970), ''Reading Capital'', 28. {{ISBN|0-902308-56-4}}.</ref> Thus, Althusser's project is to help readers fully grasp the originality and power of Marx's extraordinary theory, giving as much attention to what is not said as to the explicit. Althusser holds that Marx has discovered a "continent of knowledge", History, analogous to the contributions of [[Thales]] to [[mathematics]], [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] to [[physics]],<ref>Althusser, L., "Philosophy as a Revolutionary Weapon" (1968) in ''Lenin and Philosophy and other Essays'' (1971), pp. 13–26, 18. {{ISBN|0-902308-89-0}}</ref> or, better, Freud's [[psychoanalysis]],<ref>Althusser, L., "Lenin and Philosophy" (1968) in ''Lenin and Philosophy and other Essays'' (1971), pp. 27–66, 42. {{ISBN|0-902308-89-0}}</ref> in that the structure of his theory is unlike anything posited by his predecessors.

Althusser believes that Marx's work is fundamentally incompatible with its antecedents because it is built on a groundbreaking [[epistemology]] (theory of knowledge) that rejects the distinction between [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] and [[object (philosophy)|object]]. In opposition to [[empiricism]], Althusser claims that Marx's philosophy, [[dialectical materialism]], counters the theory of knowledge as vision with a theory of knowledge as production.<ref>Althusser, L. and Balibar, E. (1970), ''Reading Capital'', 24.</ref> On the empiricist view, a knowing subject encounters a real object and uncovers its essence by means of abstraction.<ref>Althusser, L. and Balibar, E., ''Reading Capital'', 36. It should be noted that Althusser's definition of "empiricism" is much broader than the traditional one.</ref> On the assumption that thought has a direct engagement with reality, or an unmediated vision of a "real" object, the empiricist believes that the truth of knowledge lies in the correspondence of a subject's thought to an object that is external to thought itself.<ref>Althusser, L. and Balibar, E., ''Reading Capital'', 36–42</ref> By contrast, Althusser claims to find latent in Marx's work a view of knowledge as "theoretical practice". For Althusser, theoretical practice takes place entirely within the realm of thought, working upon theoretical objects and never coming into direct contact with the real object that it aims to know.<ref>Althusser, L. and Balibar, E. (1970), ''Reading Capital'', 41–43</ref> Knowledge is not discovered, but rather produced by way of three "Generalities": (1) the "raw material" of pre-scientific ideas, abstractions and facts; (2) a conceptual framework (or "problematic") brought to bear upon these; and (3) the finished product of a transformed theoretical entity, concrete knowledge.<ref>Althusser, L. (1969). "On the Materialist Dialectic" in ''For Marx'' (1969), pp. 161–218, 183–85. Verso {{ISBN|1-84467-052-X}}.</ref> In this view, the validity of knowledge does not lie in its correspondence to something external to itself; because Marx's historical materialism is a science, it contains its own internal methods of proof.<ref>Althusser, L. and Balibar, E. (1970), ''Reading Capital'', 59–60</ref> It is therefore not governed by interests of society, class, ideology, or politics, and is distinct from the [[base and superstructure|superstructure]].

In addition to its unique epistemology, Marx's theory is built on concepts—such as [[Means of production|forces]] and [[relations of production]]—that have no counterpart in classical [[political economy]].<ref>Althusser, L. and Balibar, E. (1970), ''Reading Capital'', 166–68.</ref> Even when existing terms are adopted—for example, the theory of [[surplus value]], which combines [[David Ricardo]]'s concepts of rent, profit, and interest—their meaning and relation to other concepts in the theory is significantly different.<ref>Althusser, L. and Balibar, E., (1970). ''Reading Capital'', 168–70.</ref> However, more fundamental to Marx's "break" is a rejection of [[homo economicus]], or the idea, held by the [[classical economics|classical economists]], that the needs of individuals can be treated as a fact or "given" independent of any economic organisation. For the classical economists, individual needs can serve as a premise for a theory explaining the character of a [[mode of production]] and as an independent starting point for a theory about society.<ref>Althusser, L. and Balibar, E. (1970). ''Reading Capital'', 161–67.</ref> Where classical political economy explains economic systems as a response to individual needs, Marx's analysis accounts for a wider range of social phenomena in terms of the parts they play in a structured whole. Consequently, Marx's ''Capital'' has greater explanatory power than does political economy because it provides both a model of the economy and a description of the structure and development of a whole society. In Althusser's view, Marx does not simply argue that human needs are largely created by their social environment and thus vary with time and place; rather, he abandons the very idea that there can be a theory about what people are like that is prior to any theory about how they come to be that way.<ref>Althusser, L., "Is It Simple to Be a Marxist in Philosophy" (1975) in ''Essays in Self-Criticism'' (1976), pp. 163–215, 205. {{ISBN|0-902308-87-4}}</ref>

Although Althusser insists that there was an epistemological break,<ref>Althusser, L. (1974), "Elements of Self-Criticism", 107–118</ref> he later states that its occurrence around 1845 is not clearly defined, as traces of humanism, historicism, and [[Hegelianism]] are found in ''[[Das Kapital|Capital]]''.<ref>Althusser, L., "Preface to ''Capital'' Volume One" (1969) in ''Lenin and Philosophy and Other Essays'' (1971), pp. 69–96, 90 {{ISBN|0-902308-89-0}}.</ref> He states that only Marx's ''[[Critique of the Gotha Programme]]''<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ Found online here]</ref> and some marginal notes on a book by [[Adolph Wagner]]<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1881/01/wagner.htm Found online here]</ref> are fully free from humanist ideology.<ref>Althusser, L., "Preface to ''Capital'' Volume One" (1969), 90.</ref> In line with this, Althusser replaces his earlier definition of Marx's philosophy as the "theory of theoretical practice" with a new belief in "politics in the field of history"<ref>Althusser, L. (1973). "Reply to John Lewis", 68 in ''Essays in Self-Criticism'' (1976), pp. 35–79 {{ISBN|0-902308-87-4}}</ref> and "class struggle in theory".<ref>Althusser, L. (1976). "Elements of Self-Criticism", 142.</ref> Althusser considers the epistemological break to be a ''process'' instead of a clearly defined ''event'' — the product of incessant struggle against ideology. Thus, the distinction between ideology and science or philosophy is not assured once and for all by the epistemological break.<ref>Althusser, L. (1976). "Elements of Self-Criticism", 119–25</ref>

===Levels and practices===
Because of Marx's belief that the individual is a product of society, Althusser holds that it is pointless to try to build a social theory on a prior conception of the individual. The subject of observation is not individual human elements, but rather "structure". As he sees it, Marx does not explain society by appealing to the properties of individual persons—their beliefs, desires, preferences, and judgements. Rather, Marx defines society as a set of fixed "levels"<ref>Althusser, L. and Balibar, E. ''Reading Capital'', 99–100.</ref> and "practices".<ref>Althusser, L. (1969). "On the Materialist Dialectic" in ''For Marx'' (1969), pp. 161–218, 166–67. Verso {{ISBN|1-84467-052-X}}.</ref> He uses this analysis to defend Marx's [[historical materialism]] against the charge that it crudely posits a base (economic level) and [[base and superstructure|superstructure]] (culture/politics) "rising upon it" and then attempts to explain all aspects of the superstructure by appealing to features of the (economic) base (the well known architectural metaphor). For Althusser, it is a mistake to attribute this [[economic determinism|economic determinist]] view to Marx. In much the same way that Althusser criticises the idea of a social theory founded on an historical conception of human needs, so he critiques the idea that [[economic]] practice can be used in isolation to explain other aspects of society.<ref>Althusser, L. (1969). "On the Materialist Dialectic", 205.</ref> Althusser believes that both the base and the superstructure are interdependent, although he keeps to the classic Marxist materialist understanding of the [[Economic determinism|determination]] of the base "in the last instance" (albeit with some extension and revision). The advantage of levels and practices over individuals as a starting point is that although each practice is only a part of a complex whole of society, a practice is a whole in itself in that it consists of a number of different kinds of parts. Economic practice, for example, contains raw materials, tools, individual persons, etc., all united in a process of production.<ref>Althusser, L. (1969). "On the Materialist Dialectic", 166–67.</ref>

Althusser conceives of society as an interconnected collection of these wholes: economic practice, ideological practice, and [[politics|politico]]-[[legal]] practice. Although each practice has a degree of relative autonomy, together they make up one complex, structured whole (social formation).<ref>Althusser, L. and Balibar, E. (1970). ''Reading Capital'', 58</ref> In his view, all levels and practices are dependent on each other. For example, among the [[relations of production]] of [[capitalism|capitalist]] societies are the buying and selling of [[labor power|labour power]] by capitalists and [[workers]]. These relations are part of economic practice, but can only exist within the context of a legal system which establishes individual agents as buyers and sellers; furthermore, the arrangement must be maintained by political and ideological means.<ref>Althusser, L. and Balibar, E. (1970). ''Reading Capital'', 177–78.</ref> From this it can be seen that aspects of economic practice depend on the superstructure and vice versa.<ref>Althusser, L. (1969). "On the Materialist Dialectic", 177</ref> For him this was the moment of ''reproduction'' and constituted the important role of the superstructure.

===Contradiction and overdetermination===
An analysis understood in terms of interdependent levels and practices helps us to conceive of how society is organised, but also comprehend social change and thus provides a theory of [[history]]. Althusser explains the reproduction of the [[relations of production]] by reference to aspects of ideological and political practice; conversely, the emergence of new production relations can be explained by the failure of these mechanisms. Marx's theory seems to posit a system in which an imbalance in two parts could lead to compensatory adjustments at other levels, or sometimes to a major reorganisation of the whole. To develop this idea, Althusser relies on the concepts of contradiction and non-contradiction, which he claims are illuminated by their relation to a complex structured whole. Practices are contradictory when they "grate" on one another and non-contradictory when they support one another. Althusser elaborates on these concepts by reference to [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's]] analysis of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]].<ref>Althusser, L. (1969). "Contradiction and Overdetermination", 94–100, in ''For Marx'', pp. 87–128.</ref>

Lenin posited that despite widespread discontent throughout Europe in the early 20th century, Russia was the country in which revolution occurred because it contained all the contradictions possible within a single state at the time.<ref>Althusser, L., "Contradiction and Overdetermination", 95.</ref> In his words, it was the "weakest link in a chain of imperialist states".<ref>Althusser, L. (1969). "Contradiction and Overdetermination", 97.</ref> He explained the revolution in relation to two groups of circumstances: firstly, the existence within Russia of large-scale exploitation in cities, mining districts, etc., a disparity between urban industrialisation and medieval conditions in the countryside, and a lack of unity amongst the ruling class; secondly, a foreign policy which played into the hands of revolutionaries, such as the elites who had been exiled by the [[Tsar]] and had become sophisticated [[socialists]].<ref>Althusser, L. (1969). "Contradiction and Overdetermination", 96–97.</ref>

For Althusser, this example reinforces his claim that Marx's explanation of social change is more complex than the result of a single contradiction between the forces and the relations of production.<ref>Althusser, L., "Contradiction and Overdetermination", 99.</ref> The differences between events in Russia and [[Western Europe]] highlight that a contradiction between forces and relations of production may be necessary, but not sufficient, to bring about revolution.<ref>Althusser, L. (1969). "Contradiction and Overdetermination", 99.</ref> The circumstances that produced revolution in Russia, mentioned above, were heterogeneous, and cannot be seen to be aspects of one large contradiction.<ref name="ReferenceA">Althusser, L., "Contradiction and Overdetermination", 100</ref> Each was a contradiction within a particular social totality, at a different structural level of social practice. From this, Althusser concludes that Marx's concept of contradiction is inseparable from the concept of a complex structured social whole. To emphasise that changes in social structures relate to numerous contradictions, Althusser describes these changes as "[[overdetermination|overdetermined]]", using a term taken from [[Sigmund Freud]].<ref>Althusser, L., "Contradiction and Overdetermination", 101</ref> This interpretation allows us to account for the way in which many different circumstances may play a part in the course of events, and how these circumstances may combine to produce unexpected social changes or "ruptures".<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

However, Althusser does not mean to say that the events that determine social changes all have the same causal status. While a part of a complex whole, [[economic]] practice is a "structure in dominance": it plays a major part in determining the relations between other spheres, and has more effect on them than they have on it. The most prominent aspect of society (the [[religious]] aspect in [[feudal]] formations and the economic aspect in capitalist ones) is called the "dominant instance", and is in turn determined "in the last instance" by the economy. For Althusser, the [[economic]] practice of a society determines which other aspect of that society dominates the society as a whole.

Althusser's arguably more complex and materialist (than other Marxisms) understanding of contradiction in terms of the dialectic attempts to rid Marxism of the influence and vestiges of Hegelian (idealist) dialectics, and is a component part of his general anti-humanist position.

===Ideological state apparatuses===<!-- This section is linked from [[Ideology]]; 'Ideological state apparatus' and 'Ideological State Apparatus' redirect here -->
{{Main|Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses}}
Because Althusser held that a person's desires, choices, intentions, preferences, judgements, and so forth are the products of social practices, he believed it necessary to conceive of how society makes the individual in its own image. Within capitalist societies, the human individual is generally regarded as a [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] endowed with the property of being a self-conscious, "responsible" agent whose actions can be explained by his or her beliefs and thoughts. However, for Althusser, a person's capacity to perceive himself or herself in this way is not innate or given. Rather, it is acquired within the structure of established social practices, which impose on individuals the role (''forme'') of a subject.<ref>As Althusser states, "No human, i.e. social individual can be the agent of a practice if he does not have the ''form of a subject''. The 'subject-form' is actually the form of the historical existence of every individual, of every agent of social practices." Althusser, L. (1973), "Reply to John Lewis" in ''Essays in Self-Criticism'' (1976), pp. 33–100, 95. {{ISBN|0-902308-87-4}}.</ref> Social practices both determine the characteristics of the individual and give him or her an idea of the range of properties that he or she can have, and of the limits of each individual. Althusser argues that many of our roles and activities are given to us by social practice: for example, the production of steelworkers is a part of [[economic]] practice, while the production of lawyers is part of [[politics|politico]]-[[legal]] practice. However, other characteristics of individuals, such as their beliefs about [[the good life]] or their [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] reflections on the nature of the self, do not easily fit into these categories.

In Althusser's view, our values, desires, and preferences are inculcated in us by [[ideological]] practice, the sphere which has the defining property of constituting individuals as subjects.<ref>Althusser, L. (1970), "Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses" in ''Lenin and Philosophy and other Essays'' (1971), pp. 121–76, 160. {{ISBN|0-902308-89-0}}. Available online here [http://www.marx2mao.com/Other/LPOE70ii.html] and here [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/althusser/1970/ideology.htm]</ref> Ideological practice consists of an assortment of institutions called "Ideological State Apparatuses" (ISAs), which include the family, the media, religious organisations, and most importantly in capitalist societies, the education system, as well as the received ideas that they propagate.<ref>Althusser, L. (1970), "Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses", 135–39</ref> There is, however, no single ISA that produces in us the belief that we are self-conscious agents. Instead, we derive this belief in the course of learning what it is to be a daughter, a schoolchild, black, a steelworker, a councillor, and so forth.

Despite its many institutional forms, the function and structure of ideology is unchanging and present throughout history;<ref>Althusser, L. (1970), "Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses", 152</ref> as Althusser states, "ideology has no history".<ref>Althusser, L. (1970), "Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses", 150</ref> All ideologies constitute a subject, even though he or she may differ according to each particular ideology. Memorably, Althusser illustrates this with the concept of "hailing" or "[[interpellation (philosophy)|interpellation]]". Drawing heavily from [[Jacques Lacan]] and his concept of the [[Mirror Stage]],<ref>Althusser, L. (1970), "Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses", 162</ref> he compares ideology to a policeman shouting "Hey you there!" toward a person walking on the street. Upon hearing this call, the person responds by turning around and in doing so, is transformed into a [[subject (philosophy)|subject]].<ref>Althusser, L. (1970), "Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses", 163.</ref> The person is conscious of being a subject and aware of the other person. Thus, for Althusser, being aware of other people is a form of ideology. Within that, Althusser sees subjectivity as a type of ideology. The person being hailed recognizes himself or herself as the subject of the hail, and knows to respond.<ref>Althusser, L. (1970), "Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses", 163</ref> Althusser calls this recognition a "mis-recognition" (''méconnaissance''),<ref>Althusser, L. (1970), "Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses", 161</ref> because it works retroactively: a material individual is always already an ideological subject, even before he or she is born.<ref name="Althusser, L. 1970">Althusser, L. (1970), "Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses", 164</ref> The "transformation" of an individual into a subject has always already happened; Althusser here acknowledges a debt to [[Spinoza]]'s theory of [[immanence]].<ref name="Althusser, L. 1970"/> To highlight this, Althusser offers the example of [[Christian]] religious ideology, embodied in the Voice of [[God]], instructing a person on what his place in the world is and what he must do to be reconciled with [[Christ]].<ref>Althusser, L. (1970), "Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses", 166</ref> From this, Althusser draws the point that in order for that person to identify as a Christian, he must first already be a subject; that is, by responding to God's call and following His rules, he affirms himself as a free agent, the author of the acts for which he assumes responsibility.<ref>Althusser, L. (1970), "Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses", 169</ref> We cannot recognize ourselves outside ideology, and in fact, our very actions reach out to this overarching structure. For Althusser, we acquire our identities by seeing ourselves mirrored in ideologies.<ref>Althusser, L. (1970), "Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses", 168</ref>

==Reception and influence==
Although Althusser's theories were born of an attempt to defend Communist orthodoxy{{clarifyme|date=April 2016}}, the eclecticism of his influences—drawing equally from contemporary structuralism, philosophy of science, and psychoanalysis as from thinkers in the Marxist tradition—reflected a move away from the intellectual isolation of the [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin era]]. Furthermore, his thought was symptomatic of Marxism's growing academic respectability and of a push towards emphasising Marx's legacy as a [[philosopher]] rather than only as an [[economist]] or [[sociologist]]. [[Tony Judt]] saw this as a criticism of Althusser's work, saying he removed Marxism "altogether from the realm of history, politics and experience, and thereby ... render[ed] it invulnerable to any criticism of the empirical sort."<ref>New Republic, V. 210, 03-07-1994, p. 33.</ref>

Althusser has had broad influence in the areas of [[Marxist philosophy]] and [[post-structuralism]]: interpellation has been popularised and adapted by the [[feminist]] philosopher and critic [[Judith Butler]], and elaborated further by [[Göran Therborn]]; the concept of ideological state apparatuses has been of interest to [[Slovenia]]n philosopher [[Slavoj Žižek]]; the attempt to view history as a process without a [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] garnered sympathy from [[Jacques Derrida]]; [[historical materialism]] was defended as a coherent doctrine from the standpoint of [[analytic philosophy]] by [[G. A. Cohen]];<ref>Cohen, G. A., ''Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence'', x. Oxford University Press, 1978. {{ISBN|0-19-827196-4}}. Cohen claims that Althusser's work is an inadequately vague defence of Marx's theory.</ref> the interest in [[structure and agency]] sparked by Althusser was to play a role in [[Anthony Giddens]]'s [[theory of structuration]]; Althusser was vehemently{{qn|date=October 2012}} attacked by British [[historian]] [[E. P. Thompson]] in his book ''The Poverty of Theory''.<ref>Thompson, E. P., (1978) "The Poverty of Theory" in ''The Poverty of Theory & other essays'', pp. 193–397. Merlin, 1978. {{ISBN|0-85036-231-8}}.</ref>{{primary source-inline|date=October 2012}}

Althusser's influence is also seen in the work of economists [[Richard D. Wolff]] and [[Stephen Resnick]], who have interpreted that Marx's mature works hold a conception of class different from the normally understood ones. For them, in Marx class refers not to a group of people (for example, those that own the means of production versus those that do not), but to a process involving the production, appropriation, and distribution of surplus labor. Their emphasis on class as a process is consistent with their reading and use of Althusser's concept of overdetermination in terms of understanding agents and objects as the site of multiple determinations.

Althusser's work has also been criticized from a number of angles. In a 1971 paper for ''[[Socialist Register]]'', Polish philosopher [[Leszek Kołakowski]]<ref>Kolakowski, Leszek (1971), "[http://www.socialistregister.com/index.php/srv/article/view/5334/2235 Althusser's Marx]". ''Socialist Register'' 1971, pp. 111–28.</ref> undertook a detailed critique of structural Marxism, arguing that the concept was seriously flawed on three main points:

:I will argue that the whole of Althusser's theory is made up of the following elements: 1. common sense banalities expressed with the help of unnecessarily complicated [[neologisms]]; 2. traditional Marxist concepts that are vague and ambiguous in Marx himself (or in Engels) and which remain, after Althusser's explanation, exactly as vague and ambiguous as they were before; 3. some striking historical inexactitudes.

Kołakowski further argued that, despite Althusser's claims of scientific rigour, structural Marxism was [[unfalsifiable]] and thus unscientific, and was best understood as a quasi-religious [[ideology]]. In 1980, sociologist Axel van den Berg<ref>Berg, Axel van den (1980). "Critical Theory: Is There Still Hope?" ''The American Journal of Sociology'', Vol. 86 No. 3 (Nov 1980), pp. 449–78.</ref> described Kołakowski's critique as "devastating", proving that "Althusser retains the orthodox radical rhetoric by simply severing all connections with verifiable facts".

[[Gerald Cohen]], in his essay 'Complete Bullshit', has cited the 'Althusserian school' as an example of 'bullshit' and a factor in his co-founding the '[[Non-Bullshit Marxism Group]]'.<ref>Cohen, G.A. 'Complete Bullshit', pp. 94–5 in his ''Finding Oneself in the Other'' (ed. [[Michael Otsuka]]) (2013) Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.</ref> He says that 'the ideas that the Althusserians generated, for example, of the interpellation of the subject, or of contradiction and overdetermination, possessed a surface allure, but it often seemed impossible to determine whether or not the theses in which those ideas figured were true, and, at other times, those theses seemed capable of just two interpretations: on one of them they were true but uninteresting, and, on the other, they were interesting, but quite obviously false'.<ref>Cohen, G.A. 'Complete Bullshit', pp. 95 in his ''Finding Oneself in the Other'' (ed. [[Michael Otsuka]]) (2013) Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.</ref>

==Legacy==
Since his death, the reassessment of Althusser's work and influence has been ongoing. The first wave of retrospective critiques and interventions ("drawing up a balance sheet") began outside of Althusser's own country, France, because, as [[Étienne Balibar]] pointed out in 1988, "there is an absolute taboo now suppressing the name of this man and the meaning of his writings."<ref name="AlthusserConference">{{cite book |last=Sprinker |first=Michael |authorlink= |author2=Kaplan, E. Ann  |editor= |others= |title= The Althusserian Legacy|origyear= |url= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |year=1993 |publisher= Verso |location= |language= |isbn=978-0-86091-594-2 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= 1|chapter= |chapterurl= |quote=}}</ref> Balibar's remarks were made at the "Althusserian Legacy" Conference organized at [[Stony Brook University|SUNY Stony Brook]] by [[Michael Sprinker]]. The proceedings of this conference were published in September 1992 as the ''Althusserian Legacy'' and included contributions from Balibar, Alex Callinicos, Michele Barrett, Alain Lipietz, Warren Montag, and Gregory Elliott, among others. It also included an obituary and an extensive interview with Derrida.<ref name="AlthusserConference"/>

Eventually, a [[:wikt:colloquium|colloquium]] was organized in France at the University of Paris VIII by [[Sylvain Lazarus]] on May 27, 1992. The general title was ''Politique et philosophie dans l'oeuvre de Louis Althusser'', the proceedings of which were published in 1993.<ref>{{cite book |last=Badiou |first=Alain |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=Pocket Pantheon: Figures of Postwar Philosophy |date=July 2009 |url= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |publisher= Verso|location= |language=|isbn=978-1-84467-357-5 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page=192 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |origyear=21 }}</ref>

In retrospect, Althusser's continuing importance and influence can be seen through his students.<ref name="stanford1">{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/althusser/ |title=Louis Althusser (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date=2009-10-16 |accessdate=2011-09-18}}</ref> A dramatic example of this points to the editors and contributors of the 1960s journal ''[[Cahiers pour l'Analyse]]'': {{quote|''In many ways, the "Cahiers" can be read as the critical development of Althusser's own intellectual itinerary when it was at its most robust''.<ref>[http://www.web.mdx.ac.uk/cahiers/names/althusser.html Althusser Homepage at The Cahiers pour l'Analyse website]</ref>}}
This influence continues to guide some of today's most significant and provocative philosophical work, as many of these same students became eminent intellectuals in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s: [[Alain Badiou]], [[Étienne Balibar]] and [[Jacques Rancière]] in [[philosophy]], [[Pierre Macherey]] in [[literary criticism]] and [[Nicos Poulantzas]] in [[sociology]]. The prominent [[Guevarist]] [[Régis Debray]] also studied under Althusser, as did the aforementioned Derrida (with whom he at one time shared an office at the ENS), noted philosopher [[Michel Foucault]], and the pre-eminent Lacanian psychoanalyst [[Jacques-Alain Miller]].<ref name="stanford1"/>

Badiou has lectured and spoken on Althusser on several occasions in France, Brazil, and Austria since Althusser's death. Badiou has written many studies, including "Althusser: Subjectivity without a Subject", published in his book ''Metapolitics'' in 2005. Most recently, Althusser's work has been given prominence again through the interventions of [[Warren Montag]] and his circle; see for example the special issue of ''borderlands e-journal'' edited by David McInerney (''Althusser & Us'') and "Décalages: An Althusser Studies Journal", edited by Montag. (See "External links" below for access to both of these journals.)

In 2011 Althusser continued to spark controversy and debate with the publication in August of that year of Jacques Rancière's first book, ''Althusser's Lesson'' (1974). It marked the first time this groundbreaking work was to appear in its entirety in an English translation. In 2014, ''On the Reproduction of Capitalism'' was published, which is an English translation of the full text of the work from which the ISAs text was drawn.<ref>http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/kill-the-philosopher-in-your-head/</ref>

The publication of Althusser's posthumous memoir{{cn|date=October 2015}} cast some doubt on his own scholarly practices. For example, although he owned thousands of books, Althusser revealed that he knew very little about Kant, Spinoza, and Hegel. While he was familiar with Marx's early works, he had not read ''Capital'' when he wrote his own most important Marxist texts. Additionally, Althusser had "contrived to impress his first teacher, the Catholic theologian Jean Guitton, with a paper whose guiding principles he had simply filched from Guitton's own corrections of a fellow student's essay," and "he concocted fake quotations in the thesis he wrote for another major contemporary philosopher, Gaston Bachelard."<ref name=Adair />
