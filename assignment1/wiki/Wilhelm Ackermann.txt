'''Wilhelm Friedrich Ackermann''' (29 March 1896 &ndash; 24 December 1962) was a [[Germany|German]] [[mathematician]] best known for the [[Ackermann function]], an important example in the [[theory of computation]].

Ackermann was born in [[Herscheid]] municipality, [[Germany]], and was awarded a Ph.D. by the [[University of Göttingen]] in 1925 for his thesis ''Begründung des "tertium non datur" mittels der Hilbertschen Theorie der Widerspruchsfreiheit'', which was a consistency proof of arithmetic apparently without full [[Peano axioms|Peano induction]] (although it did use e.g. induction over the length of proofs). From 1929 until 1948, he taught at the Arnoldinum Gymnasium in [[Steinfurt|Burgsteinfurt]], and then at [[Lüdenscheid]] until 1961. He was also a corresponding member of the Akademie der Wissenschaften (''Academy of Sciences'') in Göttingen, and was an honorary professor at the [[University of Münster]].

In 1928, Ackermann helped [[David Hilbert]] turn his 1917 &ndash; 22 lectures on introductory [[mathematical logic]] into a text, ''[[Principles of Mathematical Logic]]''. This text contained the first exposition ever of [[first-order logic]], and posed the problem of its [[Gödel's completeness theorem|completeness]] and [[Decidability (logic)|decidability]]  ([[Entscheidungsproblem]]). Ackermann went on to construct [[consistency proof]]s for [[set theory]] (1937), [[Peano arithmetic|full arithmetic]] (1940), [[Logic|type-free logic]] (1952), and a new [[axiomatic set theory|axiomatization]] of [[set theory]] (1956).

Although Ackermann did not choose a university career and rather continued as a high school teacher, he was continually engaged in research and published many contributions to the foundations of mathematics until the end of his life.  He died in [[Lüdenscheid]], [[Germany]].
