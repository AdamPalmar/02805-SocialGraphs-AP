'''Michael Paul Fourman''' [[FBCS]] (born 12 September 1950) is Professor of Computer Systems at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in Scotland, UK, and was Head of the School of [[Informatics (academic field)|Informatics]] from 2001–2009.

Fourman is interested in applications of [[logic]] in [[computer science]], [[artificial intelligence]], and [[cognitive science]] – more specifically, [[formal model]]s of [[digital system]]s, [[system design]] tools, [[proof assistant]]s, [[categorical semantics]] and [[propositional planning]].

==Qualifications==

Fourman received a BSc in Mathematics with other subjects (Philosophy and Computer Science) from the [[University of Bristol]] in 1971, then his MSc in [[Mathematical Logic]] from the [[University of Oxford]] in 1972. He wrote his [[DPhil]] thesis ''Connections between Category Theory and Logic'' under the supervision of [[Dana Scott]] at Oxford, defending his thesis in 1974.

==Career==

He continued to work with Scott as an [[Science and Engineering Research Council|SRC]] postdoctoral Research Fellow and Junior Research Fellow of [[Wolfson College, Oxford|Wolfson College]], in Oxford, until 1976, when he moved to the USA, first as a Visiting Assistant Professor of Mathematics at [[Clark University]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], then, from 1977–1982, as [[Joseph Ritt|JF Ritt]] Assistant Professor of Mathematics at [[Columbia University]] in New York.

In 1983 he moved, with a [[Science and Engineering Research Council]] Fellowship, to the Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering at [[Brunel University]]. He was appointed to a Readership, and then to the Chair of Formal Systems, at Brunel in 1986.

Fourman was co-founder and Technical Director of Abstract Hardware Limited (AHL), a company formed in 1986. He was central in the development of the [[LAMBDA system]] (Logic And Mathematics Behind Design Automation) to aid [[hardware design]], a tool implemented in the [[Standard ML|SML]] programming language and marketed by AHL. He left the company in 1997.

In 1988 he joined the [[Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]], and was appointed to the Chair of Computer Systems in the Department of Computer Science.
In 1998 he was founding Head of the Division of Informatics, which became the current [[University of Edinburgh School of Informatics|School of Informatics]], incorporating the former Department of Artificial Intelligence, the [[Artificial Intelligence Applications Institute]], the Centre for Cognitive Science, the [[Human Communication Research Centre]], and the Department of Computer Science.

He has again been Head of the School of Informatics since August 2002.

He has held visiting positions at universities in [[University of Paris|Paris]] (1975), [[Utrecht University|Utrecht]] (1977, 1980), [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] (1979–80), [[University of Sydney|Sydney]] (1982), [[McGill University|Montreal]] (1983), and [[University of Western Australia|Perth]] (1994).
